I swear to God I put the hero in heroin (Dope), these flows kilos

Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week (All week)

Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her

[Verse]
Yeah, okay

They haven't got the memo, I'm sayin' I'm the shit, though
Tryna make it complicated when this shit is simple (Simple)
Tell me what you wanna be, what your dreams is (What your dreams is)
A hundred G's in my jeans, I'm a genius (I'm a genius)
Sin every day, someone save me please
And get schooled, homie, change degrees (Uh-huh)
I'm the plug, what you need though? (What you need though?) I'm goin' beast mode
I keep a freak, even when she underwater she can deep throat (Wait, what?)
I made a mill' before I paid a bill (Okay)
'Cause fools worried about a wave, I'm a Navy SEAL (Okay)
Come with me, I can make your life change for real (Woo)
Always had a dream of stuntin', it ain't nothin' unless you runnin' shit (Woo)
Just a young ma'fucker with a plan (With a plan)
Thought I was the man
 [Chorus]
Back when I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was the shit (Oh, you the shit?)
When I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was a king (Oh, you a king?)
When I first made a hundred grand
Couldn't tell me nuttin' (I ain't sayin' nuttin')
When I first made a hundred grand
Made a hundred grand (Let me get some money)

What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
ספר לי על הפחדים שלך
What are you afraid of? (Uh)
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
One-two, one-two, uh
Tell me your fears
Sometimes I see the... Is everything okay?
ספר לי על הפחדים שלך, uh
Tell me your fears

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Sometimes I see the world for how fucked up it really is
I tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it
I could die tonight, not make it to the sunrise
Then I couldn't heal the pain in it
I'm gettin' high to forget about the lows, though
Get a pay check, spend it all on polo
Designer brands cover up my insecurities
Personally I ain't nothin' but an average Joe, though
Now I'm dressin' so expensive for no reason
Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezin'
I got some fam who can't afford a coat
So I leave a little paper there before I go
Spent a thousand on a hotel, they poor and broke
Made me wonder who I'm prayin' to before the show
This a letter to whoever, I'm just tryna set you free
Remember love if you can't remember me
 [Chorus: Mac Miller]
Dear people on Earth after I die
What's the weather like?
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
And I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe
Get a second life
This time I'ma get it right

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
It's either God or the devil with these drugs I'm on
I don't know if we were meant to see it all like this
Still, plantin' seeds so my money long
Money addict, it's a habit that palms gon' itch
I wish we could just all get rich
Sometimes not havin' money is all I miss
And, yeah, these hoes are all up on my dick
The all American girl, that's just a blonde hair bitch
Am I supposed to have some thoughts like this?
Could we figure out what God might've miss?
It's funny that these questions never get an answer
Life a bitch sometimes, you gotta reprimand her
Never understand her, why should I even try?
Live forever then you'll never feel the need to die
This a letter, open it to set you free
Remember love and remember me
 [Chorus: Mac Miller]
Dear people on Earth after I die
What's the weather like?
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
And I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe
Get a second life
This time I'ma get it right

[Outro: Mac Miller]
What does it mean to be a sensation?
Do you have to be sensational?
And how you know you made it?
When you're with Killa Cam watchin' Paid in Full, I
Never had good grades in school, but
Shock the world is what I came to do, I
Got a song I wanna play for you
So can you sing that back to me? I said
What does it mean to be a sensation?
Do you have to be sensational?
How you know you made it?
When you're with Killa Cam watchin' Paid in Full, I
Never had good grades in school, but
Shock the world is what I came to do, I
Got a song I wanna play for you
So can you sing that back to me?"

Yeah

[Verse 1]
We fill their head with lies, like lemme change yo' life
Let's become friends tonight, I'll show you what Heaven's like
Ma-ma-make sure yo' dress is tight, show me them legs and thighs
Feel it up, girl, that's just right, sex is an exercise
Th-th-th-these dudes intimidated, you-you-you got 'em petrified
N-n-n-n-now you gettin' naked, girl, you just read my mind
Pop this, get energized, sniff this, get еxtra high
All them celebs you likе, let's be just like them tonight
You work from 10 to 5, strippin' to just get by
You ain't no weddin' bride, open up, lemme check inside
That well is never dry, must confess, I'll testify
Lord, that pussy felt divine, I came back a second time

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I see them temptin' eyes, you on yo' best behavior
You got work in the mornin', we'll worry 'bout that later
This time, girl, let it slide, you feel so wet inside
That pussy never lie (Good, good), girl, that pussy never lie

[Chorus]
It's 2004 (Good, good; girl, that pussy never lie)
It's 2004 (That-that-that-that-that-that pussy never lie)
Girl, do it like 2004 (Good, good, good, good; girl, that pussy never lie)
Girl, do it like 2004 (That pussy never lie, that-that pussy never lie)
 [Open Verse]

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I see them temptin' eyes, you on yo' best behavior

[Chorus]
It's 2004 (Good, good; girl, that pussy never lie)
It's 2004 (That-that-that-that-that-that pussy never lie)

Yeah
Eric
Well

[Chorus]
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' ""Why?"" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

[Verse 1]
Yeah, okay, you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's alright with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'
The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about
And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yea high and muddy
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me
 [Chorus]
But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' ""Why?"" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war
See, me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it, I was diggin' me a hole
Big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
My own, with these arms I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone, and I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm
 [Chorus]
Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' ""Why?"" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' ""Why?"" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more

I could see why they get so jealous
I want it all for myself, I'm selfish
I don't consider that greedy, 'cause there just ain't enough to go around
Every now and then I freak out, 'cause I work week round to make sure we all good
There just ain't enough to go around

[Verse]
Yeah, well
Why does everybody look so worried?
Why they always running, but they never in a hurry?
I just want to show off my brand new car
It cost so much, I'm too scared to park it
We swimming in this ocean, though beware of sharks please
They'll get you if come within arms reach
I'm cooking somеthing, get away from my parsley
I hit the lick and dip in thе Harley
My life so gnarly, beyond your wildest dreams
Private planes, flying the wings
Diamonds and things
Super, super stardom
What a tree, god damn I'm starving
It ain't no bargain
Rake your leaves and make your garden, grow your trees
The bullshit nothing, 'til it go to my knees
Came a long way from that little apartment
 [Chorus]
I could see why they get so jealous
I want it all for myself, I'm selfish
I don't consider that greedy, 'cause there just ain’t enough to go around

When the money gone, hoes vanish

Bitches won't stop callin' my line
But I'm too busy turnin' water to wine
Lot on my mind, type of things happen all of the time
You gotta get yours, but me, I gotta get mine
Homie, I made it from the basement to
Gettin' faded on stage with Snoop

If you lookin' for a king then you found one
Popped out of my mother placenta with a crown on
Got a new bitch, keep the frown on
She tell me I need to grow up
I tell her she need to get on my level and show respect to the motherfucker that's cuttin' the check
She ain't gonna be around long and that's fine
For now we naked on the couch, watchin' movies with the sound on this time
But never mind, that's another story
For a better time, when it's better for me
Cold dough burger, shit is 40
Might fuck around, pour a four in a 40
Now it's four in the mornin'
She out cold, sleepin' on the couch with her mouth wide, me, I'm still goin'
Fuck everybody but us
That's why I can't trust...

They think that I'ma lose my mind out here
Ask me where I think I'll be this time next year
But I don't care, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up
Said I don't care, I'm li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-livin' it up (Hey, hey)

They wonder where I'm gon' be at
Posted with my chief sack
Seat back, keep this shit together like a knee cap
He's that bad motherfucker with a attitude
Haters try and play him, I ain't even gettin' mad at you
Fruity Judy spittin', but he rappin' like kiwi
I receive better than your satellite TV
Creepy, the rhymes that'll give 'em heebie-jeebies
Hoes showin' titties, tryna get a CD free
Please, grass stay together like it's welted
Turnin' down groupies, now they think I'm gettin' selfish
I'm not cocky, I'm just confident
Wave you off, move along, if you not convinced
Got way too much shit up on my shoppin' list
While you're broke, doin' coke, tryna copy Vince
Hop off the dick, let me be on my way
I don't pay attention, stay havin' good days, so

Headin' to the money, no pause, no delay
Racin' like a relay, hear me through the PA
Cheef 'til I'm sleepin', fuck the D-to-the-E-A
Uh, I'm in this game, no playin' for the pesos
Try and dip into this cheese like queso
Classes never seem to be there when they take role
I was runnin' to my dream, tryna make mo'
Music, make another song
They tell me they supported, they was hatin' all along
Love greater than the hate that I was gettin', didn't phase me for a second
So lately I've been gettin' kinda crazy, and I mention
To my lady when she stressin' that I'm cakin', it's a blessin'
I'm just tryna get her in the right direction
You want a war, then I'm comin' prepared
Most Dope, put ya thumb in the air, motherfucker

They think that I'ma lose my mind out here
Ask me where I think I'll be this time next year
But I don't care, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up

It's been a while since I—
Been a while since I looked at myself
When I was a child I used to say I was gon' grow up, be somethin' someday
I guess I'm doin' alright, but there's always gonna be somethin' better
Way too many long nights with the wrong vice, I want a life I remember
I just want to write a song like somethin' God might listen to when he's stressed out
When I was high, it was let down
Got to remember that I'm blessed now
I'm feelin' way too high
I run away a lot
Sometimes I really hate my thoughts
It gets strange in my brain with no umbrella, but I stay in the rain
It's been a while since I—
It's been a while since I looked at myself

[Verse 2]
Life be so strange (So strange)
That's why you gotta see both ways (Both ways)
And when it don't feel right right here, then you gotta relocate (Uh-huh)
And we all feel, even if we don't feel the same
But don't gotta be stuck in one place no more, we can relocate
Never fly, but you always see those planes
I get jealous
We always try, but we don't change
No matter what they tell us, yeah
Head space full of dead weight
When I'm stressed, still puttin' on my best face
Never let 'em see no pain

I can't rap

[Verse]
Okay, please make yourself right at home, tell Annie take the load off
Tell Joseph take his Technicolor coat off, see, I'm Hefner with the robe off
Flow is cold as Olaf, I put my cards all on the table, first I wipe the coke off, clean
All wins, no loss, locked in, goes off
Bad bitch, clothes off, no kids, low cost
Whiskey in my hand, whiskey in my hand, I be's in trouble
Somewhere seein' double, prolly p-pissin' in my pants
Okay, I can confess, I am a mess
Urge to slap somebody, got a serious case of hand Tourette's
Thеy label me a damaged thrеat
It started getting weird once I made more than both my parents' checks
It ain't shit though, my mom be makin' ten times the banana bread
The flows is goin' hammerhead, burnin' on the amber
You my man, is there on salmon red, I'm greater than Alexander
Most of these rappers need to stop, because they'll never make a jam again
End up forty-five, with just a Walkman and a camping tent
And you can buy my album out on CD, vinyl, and cassette
I ain't a rapper, haven't copped the Lambo or the Phantom yet
I give you more Mandy, yes, sorry ‘bout that corny bar
But white girls still in middle school been most of my support thus far
Cook meth in this horse's barn, not as bad as your things are
Most of you are eating food that started on a torture farm
All the hours watching porn, I'm somethin' like a porno star
That makes me a master thief for stealing iPhone cords from cars
This is for an eagle, on my second shot and four is par
She bicycle my dick, tell me it's longer than the Tour de France
One day inside Pittsburgh, take your kids to see McCormick Park"

Blowed
Uh

[Verse]
See them thinkin' that I'm tonight's entertainment
I'm insane with the brain just like Lil Wayne is
Now I'm stumblin'
My rhythm's a little bit off-key
So I think that they lost me
I'm hangin' with the posse
We at the party and you sittin' in the lobby
And you lookin' pretty sloppy
See a lot of people always try and boss me around
Thinkin' I'm a cat that don't get tossed in the crowd
But now I'm out, loud
Spittin' out the mind
When I'm tickling the twine how I'm twisting up the dime, all up to a Swisher
Got some liquor and some beer, and it's clear that I'm right here
Full release the year that I'm gonе
Sing along 'cause my song got it goin' on
Break of dawn 'til the еarly morn'
I be right up back my rap shit
When I smack you backwards
And cats is annoying, destroying self-employing
Up on this rap shit
But these tactics is on some wack shit
And I'ma always 'bout the real, keepin' it a hundred percent
And let it get wet, but anyways people talk about the tech and the disrespect
While I sit back, pop in a bean, and smoke a cigarette
But it ain't the same shit
When you hit the deck, my flow's too amazing
BJ get his braids in, and then he grows it right back to the afro
And fa'sho, we back
And that's why the class clown's here for about a couple seconds
When I start wreckin', people steppin' from my presence
'Cause when I walk in the room everybody stop talkin'
They jaw's droppin'
Everybody see they not a option
'Cause it's just me, the world, and everybody against it
Plus my homies who I've always been friends with
I repent shit, it's hard in the struggle
You always gotta hustle 'cause it's living like a jungle
People is lions and tigers and bears and I'm really scared
But I ain't scared, no beware
'Cause Mac is here, yeah
And I got my man, deets and beats
On the sweet feet, Pistol Pete is never gon get sick of me
Check the history, I'm always real with what I do
I appeal all these cats who be sippin' down the brew
Or the cats who in the streets 'cause I'm just spittin' my shit
You gotta love it, ain't getting rid of this shit
'Cause I'm back and I'm gon' stick
So haters run away, some will ride the gun and spray
While others blunts and haze, rolled up
I'm so tough and my clothes scuffed
Your flow's butt, if you thinkin', then so what?
'Cause I ain't listenin', I be thinkin' on my own
Drinkin' when I hit her with the bone
See, she hit up on my phone, and I answer
Tellin' me that she a cute mommy, nice body, a dancer
I'ma romance her, I head up to the crib, be a gentleman
Of course she lets me in
We let the sex begin, and stop talkin'
Then I'm out, before the breakfast I start walkin'
Out the door, headin' to the elevator
My phone ringin' by some bitches, I got hella haters
But I don't care, I just keep my mind movin'
And this the type of freestyle, roll some weed to it
'Cause I think it's never gon' be finished
I'm in it, this shit's gon' go on for about twenty minutes
And if the money's in it, then I'ma get it
Never spend it if you, relentless, attempts
That this lil' mischievous shit, will not hit the flip the bic-blah
When I stumble, but shits, see the kid who never mumble
I'm humble, but now I need a drink of water"

5 o'clock in the morning
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress
A marathon grind like I'm runnin' from rest
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death (Uh)
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress (Yeah)
But I'm goin' hard 'til there's nothin' left under my chest (Haha)

The streets empty 'round 5 o'clock (Uh-huh)

Low-key microscopic to the eyes that watch (Uh-huh)
Everything a hustle when you tryna come buy some guap
I'ma keep grindin' 'til I'm shinin' like a diamond watch (Uh-huh)
Me and Bo-head bringin' you the truth (Truth)
With all-night sessions, we just livin' in the booth (Yep)
Strong bars like we spittin' out hundred-fifty proof
Take shots (Oh), get loose, 'til you spittin' up yo' food (Oh), like, ""Oh""
You see that? I'ma need a recap
Grab a weed sack, chief that 'til my feet flat (Feet flat)
I got this covered like a Pro Bowl D-back
Breathe rap and I been known to make the beat clap (Ha-ha)
Need cash so I'm tryin' move some trees fast
Tell you where the meat at, ask you where the cheese at (Yo)

Yo, I rise before the sun come up and get my day started (Chyeah)
Pray to the most high, I roll up my haze and spark it up
And then my paper starts to roll in
Money in paper bags, hammers with laser tags, we grown men (Yeah)
Out on the corner 'til the early morn'
The blood of a hustler, gettin' mines before I was born
You get scorned by these hot-ass bars from me and Easy Mac (Yeah)
Crusin' in the 'Lac (Yeah), smokin' weed with no seeds in that (No seeds)
There ain't no reason that these other rappers hatin' on us (Why?)
Except these labels anticipatin' and waitin' on us (They waitin')
To get them BBS's, radios play us
Then we blaze in the Benz, and sit this off on them BBS's (Big wheels)
Went from PA to Texas, these niggas know about me

I'm a little calm and quiet with Sinatra, I'ma fly to the moon
Spent way too much time here inside of this room
So I'ma be outside until the sky isn't blue
Until the sun isn't shinin', until I die of the flu
Yeah, okay, my necklace full of rare stones, heir to the throne
My mind is always open, but it's frozen in my soul
Somehow I'm in my zone when I'm way out of control
They keep knockin' on my door, but nobody ever home
Um, Mr. Big Stuff, I'm done with the strip clubs
Too much on my mind, I got no time to give fucks
You can call my phone, I don't pick up

The world looks smaller from a castle view

When we was grabbin' quarters for some Newports and a Mountain Dew
I dropped a album, dude, really dropped a album
Had that shit inside of stores, I'm doin' numbers on a tour
This shit is still a dream
They either is or isn't feelin' me

The devil tryna deal with me, but I don't wanna hear it

I'm nervous, I'm anxious, the hurt and the pain is so much, I can't take it
Take off in a spaceship, I love this, I hate it, I need a vacation

I be on some ""I don't give a fuck"" shit
Still with my homies I came up with
So celebrate the fact that we young, rich, and famous
 [Chorus]
I got my cup filled up (Filled up)
We came to have a good time, so turn my music high
We gon' tear this place up (Place up)
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody (Uh)
We party all around the world, we party all around the world
We party all around the world, we party all around the world

[Verse 2]
Hey, go Europe to Japan, then Mexico to France
Bitches of every nationality, get up and dance
So, let me see your hands please
We makin' noise like a stampede
So much smoke up in this bitch, you can't breathe
Somewhere where it's sandy, Cali or Miami
This the only way to do, and never made a plan B
Can't we get it how we live?
Tonight ain't the night to chill, tonight we do it big
Girls comin' all dressed up, then they takin' off their clothes (Clothes)
You know your man a amateur, come party with some pros (Pros)
You need somethin' new, I know your life is gettin' old (Old)
But we ain't gettin' younger, so tonight's the night to go (Go)
So (So,) crazy, treat it like your last night
Even if you broke, spend tonight like your cash right
This is fast life, don't you worry, baby, we ain't here to slow it down
Tonight we goin' crazy, and tomorrow you can hold me down
 [Chorus]
I got my cup filled up (Filled up)
We came to have a good time, so turn my music high
We gon' tear this place up (Place up)
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody (Uh)
We party all around the world, we party all around the world
We party all around the world, we party all around the world

Let's go around the world (Hey), around the world
Around the whole wide world (And it's the best day ever)
The whole wide world, go around the world, around the world
Around the whole wide world, the whole world
Around the world, around the whole wide world
Whole wide world, the whole wide world, the whole wide world

Girl, I don't wanna share you
We could be together, but you scared to

Uh, look
They told me never fall in love, it never works out in your favor
You way too young and right now that's just human nature
You think you love her, but you don't
Think you gon' be with her for the rest of your life, you prolly won't
But on my side, shorty just attacked me from the blindside
Used to be a player now I'm sidelined
Connect like Wi-fi, mixed like tie-dye
She feelin' cute wanna wear a little lingerie, voila
It ain't a sexual thing though
We be stayin' up smokin' weed out her window
In love with me now, she never huntin' me down
I'm tryna have it all, she ain't comin' around
It's like a never-endin' chase, longer than a marathon
See the smile on her face, and I can't help but carry on
Uh, I know you love me don't lie (Don't lie)
Uh, but you just gotta be mine, 'cause

Baby, all I'm gonna want is you

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, haha, look
I know this girl who want the world to call her own
Goin' through these dudes like some minutes on a phone
And once she leave, she ain't comin' back home
Hit the road, forgettin' about everybody she know
Miss Hasn't Called Me In Four Days
But then we hit the bed and she obsessed with foreplay
Hey, she try and be a lil' player, think she cute too
But I'ma yank her out the game like a loose tooth
When the boy blow, I know she worried (Know she worried)
About all these girls who approach me actin' flirty (Actin' flirty)
See that's the thing-thing, I don't give a fuck
I want your heart so baby give it up
In this life, girl, all we can do is try
Forget that dumb stuff, it's just you and I
We can travel 'round the world, movin' through the sky
Or we can stay right here and you'll be mine
 [Chorus]
Girl, I don't wanna share you (Share you)
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you (Leave you)

Hey, hey
Uh, and it's the best day ever
Every now and again you gotta just
Just say somethin', somethin' real
'Cause, you know, you plan on changin' the world, that's—
When it's all said and done, it's more than just
More than just rap, it's deeper than that, let's do it

[Chorus: Bun B & Mac Miller]
The people think it's all about the fame
And the money and your status in the game
But it's deeper than all that
They just want the women and the cars
Gettin' high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that
They thinkin' that it's all about the shows
And the chain hangin' down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that

[Verse 1: Bun B]
I got that money on my mind, the grind, and the ability
The knowledge and the know-how, stamina and the agility (Agility)
Soon as I step in the facility, these haters start testin' my civility
I'm tellin' ya, they killin' me (They killin' me)
Some of 'em feelin' me and some of 'em be grillin' me
But I just blow my kush smoke up to the ceilin', G (G)
Yeah, and take a toke of the Swisher smoke (Smoke)
They got the paint and the brush, but not the picture, loc (Loc)
What is an emcee if he can't rap? (Rap)
Just a monkey with a mic just waitin' to get slapped (Slapped)
And what is a DJ if he can't scratch? (Scratch)
The one rotten apple that's spolin' the whole batch (The whole batch)
What is a B-Boy if he can't break? (Break)
Might as well do the Dougie or even the Harlem Shake (The Harlem Shake)
And what is a graffiti artist if he don't tag?
No homophobia, but he's a fag
'Cause it's deeper than all that
 [Chorus: Bun B & Mac Miller]
Some people think it's all about the fame
And the money and your status in the game
But it's deeper than all that
They just want the women and the cars
Gettin' high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that
They thinkin' that it's all about the shows
And the chain hangin' down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that (Look, look)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
One time for the world 'cause we do it for y'all
Bat logo light up in the sky when the studio call
Movin' the crowd, get 'em loud without a gimmick
Spit with a golden ticket, I'm whippin' it up in minutes
My feet up in this game, you haven't even made a divot
Worried 'bout the critics, what's happenin' now, forget it
From my heart is where I give it, stay thinkin' 'bout the future
When I'm rich, I'ma call my mom before I call the movers
These haters just losers, hate to see you winnin'
Gave my all from the beginnin', I'm in it for extra innings
Here to change the world like I change clothes
Wouldn't mind a little bankroll, pesos, but I'm right here for way more
What is somebody if they can't love? A hater, someone give 'em a hug, aha
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that
 [Chorus: Bun B & Mac Miller]
The people think it's all about the fame
And the money and your status in the game
But it's deeper than all that
They just want the women and the cars
Gettin' high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that
They thinkin' that it's all about the shows
And the chain hangin' down on your clothes

Went from diggin' in the crates to chillin', gettin' faded (Faded)
Don't live a normal life, but I hope you can relate

Coolin' at the crib, can't believe it's where I live
Can't believe this what I'm doin', can't believe I got this big (Big)
Can't believe this what I'm drivin', can't believe this what I'm wearin'
Yeah, the Benz is pretty cool, but I need me a McLaren
When you see me out in public, dap me up, say, ""What's good?"" (What's good?)
Don't need to take a picture, it's better if you look (Look)
Going for your Queen, give a fuck about a rook
Papa was a player; took some pages from his book (All the time)

I'm lookin' out the window, the kid stayin' lit like a Zippo
You hatin', I don’t trip, bro, it's gravy, 'cause your bitch know
Cup of Henny, I sip slow, the spins, yo
Hit the stage to bust a rhyme, call me Flipmode
This, that, the other, I'ma make it happen
Travel all around the country in a station wagon
Take it back, you reminisce on all your favorite classics
My words play more than Mad Libs
I got plenty lyrics, they got plenty ad-libs
Warn the holy spirit, my father's on some rap shit
Listenin' to Tribe, gettin' high, puffin' lye
See some people ridin' by, come outside, say what up
I ain't nothin' like a star, I’m chillin', layin' back
Travel round the whole world, enjoyin' everywhere I'm at
Meetin' different people, eatin' different food
No one like a gourmet meal more than Q though

They feelin' kinda jealous, everybody be thinkin’ that they was cool
Gettin' money since my mommy was droppin' me off at school
Now I got a whip to cruise in
You the Pirates so you losin’, I'm in the news, you let 'em bring your news in
I bowl strikes, you always leavin' a few pins
I do me, you keepin' up with them new trends
I got fam, you worried 'bout makin' new friends
I'm in my PJs, you had to wear your suit in
Thinkin' what I'll do? When? Where? How? Why me?
Relax myself, kick it like Tai Chi
You could find me, only where I’m at
There ain't no other me's, they be checkin' on my stats
High cat, find 'im up in a tree
Homie may be spittin' bars, he ain't fuckin with me
I'm just turnin' up the heat to a hunnid degrees

Well it's alright if time ain't on your side
Even when you know that it prolly should be
And it's alright if you'd rather just close your eyes
Even when there's so much you can see

[Pre-Chorus]
You may be movin' too fast
All of that waitin' may not break ya', but it's holding you back
And we just might end up okay
Don't waste your time with tomorrow, when there's not much today

And even on my way out, too much on my mind
Things I run away from, 'til the end of time
Feel me when you need me, are you with me now?

Yeah, alright
Time is so precious when the mind it go restless
Relyin' on a vеry fine line, that's kinda recklеss
But why guess, I keep on asking my questions
Nobody telling me nothin'
I hold in breath, I just continue
Whatever I get into, I get out of
Don't know about much, so I'll just keep a loud mouth and keep talkin'
Often I'm never boxed in
Rather find a thought that I'll get lost in

I may be moving too fast (Too fast, too fast, too fast)
'Cause everything is flyin' by me, slipping out my fingers
And I keep asking, ""What happens when it gets bad?""

Become something I forget instead

Swim in Fallopian's of Ethiopian women
The wheels are spinning, moon is glistening, view exquisite
Now viewing witness, a youth that's twisted
Off purple liquid made to cure the sickness
Feel like my vision took a pitch shift
Smoking that Samson got me lifted
I'm the one who gave your girl cousin them drugs
Your little brother's plug, spit inside your mother's mug
Take her finest bottle, pour the liquor out for all my one's above
The last shot is for the homie's locked
Lit the crop, hit the lot
Double spin into the Guinness drop, pull off in fourth gear
Put it in park, the whores, they see me, say the Lord's here
My voice is hoarse from them 'Ports dear
Over here we don't support fear
Road to the riches and the course clear
I'm riding 'til the tires sparking and exhaust tear, it's on, yeah

Bout' that life, don't get your's took quick
Just a story of some kids left stranded
Couple of the homies and a couple automatics
Come to the hood, get a good pack out

You know what he about, at Ramona Park 'til after dark

Lo God nigga, coming through your motherfucking speakers, bitch ass nigga
Sold drugs in your granny building, in front the children

Baby hen on the dinner plate, I start the meal with a toast
Three assorted cheeses, they garnish the loaf
Cut the slices even
Distribute them to my assemblage of these fucking heathens
A bunch of demons in these Polo fleeces
I clutch the reefers and evade polices
I burn the Priest and vanish in the breezes
I talk to Jesus, reconsidered features
Rain dance on black sanded beaches
Pick from the tree that bare the fruit of peaches
Slaying these skeezers in the field of Eden
These backwoods got me with the heavy breathing
Connecting Venus and the shit the cheapest
I hit the party with the Sherm perm, ear-rings look like strobe lights
I cop the goldfish platforms for the cold price
Hop out the V in all sequence, bitch is Swedish
Suede Fedora, yeah my shit the meanest, you need it
And I'm the founder of the shit
On the forty-sixth floor, eating flounder with the shrimp
Got a awfully thick splore and I just pound her with the dick
Get the dope from out abroad, destroy the county with the shit

Path is limitless, death, well, that's ridiculous
I'ma live forever, 'cause a legend never die
See the world as simple, but complex in the design
I spent some time just thinkin'
Where did that get me? High, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try to understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient, halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal as a loaded gun
And I'ma shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run

Now, I can either try and be a hero
Or I can grab a one with six zeros (What?)
What would I do with a million dollars?
First off, I'd start payin' bills to my father
Then pay for college, get TreeJay a camera
Grab a spot in LA, a crib in Atlanta (Whassup?)
Cop a Phantom, just to ride in (Ride in)
Some celebrity friends to get high with (High with)
Couple foreign models that I fine dine with
'Cause the music that I make is timeless (Timeless)
The pressure's on, don't choke, Heimlich
Maneuver, got my songs all through your computer (Yes sir)
You wonderin' is it buzz or just a rumor
I'm Superman, y'all just Lex Luthor
I'ma make a mil, that's for real, no deal
Just the illest mothafucka in the buil', so chill

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Might not, feel your, face

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
You might not feel your face, but you always feel the high
And nothing last forever, except these, voices in my mind
Are we all just afraid, do they notice the change?
You see other weather, still carry umbrellas
Always be scared of the rain
And I'm still terrified of ending the pain
We live with these beautiful colors
Don't notice the shades of gray
You start to feel strange, how it cooks your brain
You wander around for no reason, can't even remember your name
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I need a little sweet, sweet amnesia
A sweet, sweet amnesia, yeah
I need a sweet amnesia, yeah
A little sweet amnesia, yeah
A sweet, sweet amnesia
A sweet, sweet amnesia
Oh, how I need yeah
Yeah, amnesia, yeah
 [Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Marlboro Red in grandmother purse
Whatever help to speed up the hearse
We livin' in hell
Lead in the shells, they lead by example
People, they ask you shoot for the stars
But all that we seen is shootin' from cars
Is shootin' the norms, they shotgunnin' beer
Wet on your eyes, suppressin' the tears
Lies you told over years, aimed at the ones that you loved
Lookin' for Heaven above you, put on a front from hope that it's real
Still young and blinded by the street lights
Hate make it hard for you to sleep tight
Do we live and die to fuckin' ease by?
In the belly of the beast, still the meek thrive
Headin' out, we run from red dots
Seem the best bet is death at young age
Least then you get the front page
Then again the love is still fake"

Whew, that drip

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Delusional Thomas]
Writin' on writer's block, haven't slept in days
They wanna put me in the psycho watch, everyone's afraid
Of what I do inside my studio, worried I'ma lose control
They rufflin' my feathers and they shufflin' the Yu-Gi-Oh!
Execution flow, at your neck like new cologne
Uno, dos, bitch, I'm in your head like Freddy Krueger though
My brain fried, always chasin' the same high
I'm too fucked up to function, do nothin' but waste time
Woke up annihilated, lyin' on the pavement
Covered in items I regurgitated under a fire escape
And I know that it's Friday, 'cause every Friday they have a parade
In-front of city hall, hear 'em celebrate, they havin' a ball
My pupils dilated, highly dehydrated, I'm lost inside a giant matrix
Isolate myself from eyes I find contagious
Jump above the comedown
I'm strung out, noddin' off inside the dugout
 [Chorus]
Don't be scared, just come with me, yeah
Feels so good to feel this free
What are you afraid of? Tell me what you made of
What are you afraid of? It's just a little angel dust

Yeah
I'm playin' hot potato on a Winnebago
The chips are stale, they taste okay though when they dipped in queso
And what's an angel with a missin' halo?
She would drop outta school to take a trip to DayGlow
Found a twenty layin' by the sewer rats
You know little Stuart hasn't been in any movies lately
He's spent his paychecks on cocaine and latex
His agent workin' hard to try and book him a commercial
What I do should not concern you, do this 'til I turn blue
Not Eric Sermon, I'm more Merlin, curses turn 'em into bird food
Hurry to make the first move, I'm walkin' like Herschel
And now we at the end of verse two, oh

Don't be scared, just come with me, yeah
Feels so good to feel this free
What are you afraid of? (Woo!) Tell me what you made of (Yeah)

Ayo, Josh
Ayo, where the fuck you at, man?
What you mean you on your way, yo?
You—our session was at 9, it's fuckin' 11
I'm out here blowed, smokin L's, waitin' for your ass
I don't even think I got—
Oh no, I definitely still got some weed for the lab
But still, when you gon' be here?
Soon? Motherfucker, how soo—oh, there you are right now
Ayo, what's good, bruh?
This is a DJ Haze exclusive (Hello?)
Ayo, what's good, bruh?
Shit, chillin'
Yeah, I'm tryin' to go to the studio or whatever
Yeah, I got shit to drop, motherfucker
I always got shit to drop, damn
Aight, you'll meet me there? Aight

[Verse]
I woke up, scratched my nuts, rolled a Swisher on the shitter, ha
Got blowed, then I light me up a cigarette
The coolest flow, Coolio movie role
Now I'm tryna head up to the lab
I headed to the studio, open the door
Say, ""What's up?"" to everybody who was posted before
I'm 'bout to record, they know I'm smokin', of course
Blow some haze in the air, pull out my notebook
Then I head up to the booth, load the beat off my email
Phone on silent, ignorin' calls from females
My man Josh sit down, get the tempo
Put on my headphones, aight, let's go (Do it)
I let go, intro of the beat's startin'
Say a couple words, try not to be retarded, ha
'Cause I'm a goofy dude doin' what I choose to do
Eatin' tracks up like some snacks, call me Scooby-Doo
Now the beat about to drop, verse one
It's like a war when the soldier pull the first gun
Everything blank, it's me and the mic
I don't read a lot, so I try and see what I write (Visualize)
Visualize the melody, hypnotize
Everybody watchin', I hope they ain't blink they eyes (Stare)
'Cause you don't wanna miss a fuckin' second when I'm catchin' wreck
I be in the booth goin' off, try and catch my breath
Couple more bars, couple seconds left
Killin' 'em softly, takin' extra steps (Yep)
They never guessed I'd be murderin' and blessin'
Aight, the first done, but before we start the second
We gotta do mad shit (Mad shit), doubles and ad-libs (Ad-libs)
And Josh make it sound like magic (Yessir)
He a old school genius with the Pro Tools
Try and school me on everything that the pros do
I tell him that he needs to think it in the book
But for now we makin' guap, just singin' on some hooks
So I don't worry 'bout the chorus, the track got a hook on it
And my verses with that, they sound good on it (Uh-huh)
Now I do a second, maybe do a third
If I'm in the mood to go crazy with my words (Chyeah)
I take a little break, got some haze to burn
The cats sittin' outside can wait they turn (Wait, bitch)
We makin' classics in this session, mom's askin' me these questions
""When you comin' home? You got school"" Ha, nah, I'm suspended
After this track done, burn the last blunt, smokin' good
Payin' for my time in stolen goods
Say peace to whoever, outside it's dark
I'm blowed and can't find where the fuck I parked
So I beep the car, oh, there it is
Let's go ahead and dip, hop in the whip, light a cigarette and sit
Got a ride home ahead of us, slumped in the back
Tell my mans with the whip to bump on my track
I'm tryna ride out, and I'm high now

Lately I just been workin', writin'
Haven't really got outta the crib too much, heh-heh

As I spend another night without a single thing to do
'Cept writin' down this music I proceed to bring to you
My man Billy hit me up, he got some weed he bringin' through
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of Swishers too (Swishers too)
That's what usually happens, deserve some cool relaxin'
Smokin' herb and laughin' at Curb Your Enthusiasm (Aha)
I'm just a regular kid (At my crib)
Doin' regular shit (Burnin' five spliffs)
I'm so high, another night alone
So I'ma pour another cup and roll another zone (Roll another zone)
I'm gone, you ain't gonna bring me back (Bring me back)
So gone, couldn't tell you where I'm at (Aha)
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
You wanna find me? Hit me on Twitter, heh-heh
Wow, that sound mad lame
People love me, they don't even know my last name (Uh)
Waitin' at the station 'til it's time that I can board the train
Headin' to the fortune, fame, should explore my brain
See what I'm thinkin' 'bout ('Bout)
Pour a little liquor, then I drink it down

It's just another night alone, heh
I spend another night alone (Spend another night alone) (Yeah, yeah)

I turn my phone on silent, I need to get away
Put on J. Cole's Warm Up and let it play
I thank God for blessin' me with life every day
And to my peoples who've gone, we'll meet at Heaven's gates
I've been sellin' haze, but I'm sure there's better ways
That I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight
Nothin' left to say, now it's time for action
No more bullshit, no more relaxin'
Rappin's my passion, so I stay writin'
Spend a couple nights and burn out all the lights in
My room, stuck in my crib like glue
That's what I do, it's nothin' new

'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone

You never notice me, you was way out of my league
Until you broke your crown, girl, you used to be a queen
What happens now? Life after royalty

Up on a church hill, acid trippin' with older men
As they tell her stories, she's seducin' 'em
But she only usin' 'em
My studio is filled with spirits

So back and forth, exchange faces over wine, playin' table tennis at dinner

Weed loud as crowd noise, we just let the amber burn

She's sayin' the place is safe for me
I told her, ""Wait for me,"" the make-believer normally disguise
Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep
Somewhere off in the master suite
Havin' dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wanders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walkin', I'm Steven Jobs or I'm Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preachin' just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah, he's a goner, fuck these prima-donnas (Woah)
I'll always wonder what happened three thousand years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?

As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of
All the time we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium (Gone)
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have, the curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meanings of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes (Uh-huh)
We all in search for substance (Substance)
That drugs your pain and numbness (Numbness)
Circumstances advancin' the second chance for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this comin' (Comin')
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrow's trend (Not again)
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days (Forgotten days)
Life, it works in such mysterious ways (Ways)
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say, ayy

This business is in need of my attention, my
Time is precious, can't afford to waste a second, no
Thе world is endin', this is fuckin' Armageddon, get rеady
When it's over, find me ridin' in a Benzi
With a bad bitch beside me, smokin' on some shit that's deadly
I'm a motherfuckin' player, I swear
Tell me where the function at, it's nothin', I'm there
If I'm in it, you can bet it's lit

[Verse 2]
And I always show my city love
I'm from a place where winters cold and three rivers run
Black and gold is in my blood
Money make these bitches come, so I don't pay 'em no mind
I just keep my distance from 'em, know they on my dick because
I'm hotter than that chicken that's cookin' inside your kitchen oven
I put the butter on the bread like an English muffin
And I been the motherfuckin' man, hunnid grand
You'll never catch the muffin man, I'm gone like long distance lovin'
I was young and dumb, little smarter now, Harvard bound
Rugged like I'm tryna put the carpet down, shit

I'm a diagnosed insomniac
An astronaut who blastin' off into the star galactic
On top of Saturn, fox-trottin' with velociraptors
The dino-aliens invaded Earth, so they could feed on hypochondriacs
Prepared for the rapture, closet hillbilly

That's white America for you, we all that matters
I'm walkin' backwards, shadowboxin' with karate masters

Gotta do more than chillin', just show up

Stay dealin' with some girls who be out all the time
And the higher that I get on this mountain I climb
To the clouds, I'ma rise over balcony, shine
From the light of the sun, tonight'll be fun
'Cause the night is still young and the rhyme to the drum
Is flowin', an island
See the ocean when I'm chillin', got me smilin', like

Give me love all day so I'm handin' it back

My mama will start to worry, beautiful, what's your hurry?
My daddy will be pacing the floor, listen to the fireplace roar
Really I better scurry, beautiful, please don't hurry
Maybe just half a drink more, put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think, baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink? No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how, your eyes are like star light
To break this spell, I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

My brother will be there at the door, waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious, gosh, your lips look delicious
Maybe just a cigarette more, never such a blizzard before
Gotta get home, but baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat, get on your knees right there
You've really been grand, I thrill when you touch my hand

I used to have a dream, now it seem that I'ma live it in real life
Gettin' free jeans, good weed, feelin' real nice
Used to think that I was too short or too dumb
Just a newcomer to the game tryna do somethin'
Used to runnin' after ice cream trucks
But now I just stroll, lacе my Nikes up
I'm a nice, clean cut, good lookin' individual
Fillin' up a notebook with rhymes when I be in the school
Learn quick that nobody here invincible
We feel big, but in reality, we minuscule
Try and make a million bucks before I reach my pinnacle
Supernova status from basically invisible
Growin' up thinkin' it was cool to be a criminal
Until I saw a couple homies go down
See, now that isn't me or anything I'm finna be
I want the money, cars, hoes, clothes, a kid can dream
I used to talk to girls that wasn't even into me
Now they hit me up wantin' intimacy
But nah, I got a girl and she down for me
My little Juliet chillin' on the balcony
If I need it, she gon' run a hundred miles for me
Love me for me, not who I'm 'bout to be
And if they didn't believe, then I can do without 'em
'Cause at the end of the day I'm just Malcolm

Just a little snotty nose tryna find his pot of gold
Stayin' up late on the phone, always callin' hoes
Never thought I'd blow, no one took me serious
Now they see me walkin' down the street like, ""Oh, there he is""
As a kid, anything was possible
But mama knows the hottest flow don't put me on the honor roll
Grades started slippin', the classes I be skippin'
Tried to tell me that I was a fool, I wouldn't listen, no
As a youngin' I was playin' pretend
My wonder years, never woulda thought they could end
Back, back in my glory days, way before the haze
A good night sleep had me energized for the day
When I would look up at the planets in they orbit
Before this life got distorted
Before the money was a plan
Before I ever thought that I would need to be a man
Somethin' like a Peter Pan, nah, I ain't tryna grow up
'Cause bein' old sucks, I just wanna go nuts
Before I drank a beer or ever took a hit of weed
When entertainment was my mom's readin' mysteries
Takin' you back to them nursery rhymes
When I thought the world just deserved to be mine
Said I'm takin' you back to them nursery rhymes
Back to the beginning, put the verse in rewind
 [Chorus]
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, ""Ha-ha-ha""

Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, ""Ha-ha-ha""

'Cause these cats need to get they own style (Uh-huh)
Hold the phone dial, I go miles (Chyeah)
When I'm sprintin' on the beat, you'll get lifted off your feet
When you spliffin' up my trees, quit givin' me a speech
I ain't really tryna hear this (Nah)
See, with these lyrics, I'm tryna run fearless
We playin' games in this jungle, Jumanji
With bomb tree, hidden under all my dirty laundry (Haha)
Call me an arm free fuckin' around
I'm puttin' words in your mind 'til you in love with the sound (Come on, man)
They savin' my place, tryna shove this food in my face
So they force it down my throat 'til I'm used to the taste
Now move to your place (Yup), 'cause I'm campin' out on top
Fresh kicks on my feet while you sittin' in some socks (Haha)
Cops tryna get me locked, catch me fuckin' with shenanigans (Fuck 'em)
But I'll just handle 'em and throw 'em in the ambulance (Bitch)
They wanna know what my hands is in, scare me straight (Huh?)
Get back, bitch, I ain't tryna share my plate (You know)
What's good, fam? I love money, I will marry cake
Get a rich bitch like Ashley and Mary Kate
And I ain't talkin' 'bout one of 'em (Nope), I'm gettin' both (Yup)
I grab 'em, get a loaf, then take their money and they coats (Give me that)
I blow trees, so my mouth is always filled with smoke
You sniffin' coke, singin' but you haven't hit a note (Ah)
Plus that shit you wrote isn't set to carry a crowd
I'm legendary anywhere that I'm out (They know)
I'm sharin' this pound with my people like a How High sequel
Told my people, ""Need to air out the house"" (Oof)
So beware of my mouth, spittin' venom, comin' out the cerebellum
With these kicks on my feet, see, I told you I was gellin' (Yes sir)
You playin' felon, you in stealin' a penny
I put a hole in your belly like you Oprah or Jenny (Chyeah)
 [Chorus]
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
(Haha, keep those motherfuckers rollin' up, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (Haha, yeah)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (Oh, I'm at the party now, look)

[Verse 2]
I sport a long white tee, fitted cap, baggy pants (You know)
If you see me, please be sure to slap my hand (What's good?)
Some people do it for the love, some people do it 'cause they can
But me, I'm tryna be a legend like Bagger Vance (Yes sir)
Some rap will make you think, while other shit'll make you dance
So I bump whatever's in the system, try and make some plans
(Ayo, what's good, dog?)
I just wanna see what's good for the night time
If nothing's hype, I'ma head up to the crib and write rhymes
Age like white wine, nicer by the second (So nice)
That's why I never put punctuation on a sentence
'Cause the song goes on (Goes on), hear a dope song
If they said I wasn't for real, then you was told wrong
See, you ain't on what we on
You bright, I'm neon
I'm smokin' up the weed 'til the tree gone, yeah
My life's up and down like a see-saw
So I stay with a bitch like my name was Leon Phelps
 [Chorus]
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (That's how it is, man)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (Soul Theory Productions, baby)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (EZ Mac)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another (The Ill Spoken)
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Okay, it's your boy Wiz Khalifa, man
The prince of the 4-1, um, 2
In here with my guy, young Mac Miller

I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
'Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets

'Cause that just ain't my style

If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half-insane, and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothin' that you changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin', I'll be in another zone
Move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Find a difference from the ground and the floor
If we gotta fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie, I'll be sure

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, said what’s the problem with a love song?
'Cause so much in your mind, a conversation keep me up long
All the things I've done wrong, all the things you do right
My day job, that’s chaos, let’s take off into night
I get a new flight to get back to you sooner
Let’s do the things that you like, keep away from that computer, uh
Let’s catch a movie, baby, what have been you doin' lately?
You been right in front of me, little girl, I’ve been hallucinatin'
Said happily ever after, it’s how we always saw it
I don’t treat her like an object, no, my mama raised me right
But baby girl, that pussy callin' on me
Play the keys for hеr like Alicia, she be fallin' for mе
And lately, we ain’t been talkin' too much
The way you look tonight, I could marry ya 'cause I don’t want to lose ya, woah

Don’t you ever in your whole life forget you are beautiful
You’re so beautiful, baby girl, you’re so beautiful
Yeah, you’re so beautiful
Yeah, baby girl, you’re so beautiful

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
See, I love women, and I done a lot of pimpin'
But for now, if it ain’t you girl, it don’t fit in my description, no
She from my hometown, moved into her own house
And lately, I’ve been trippin' every single time she go out
Shit, she get drunk, start yellin' at me
Cold as ice, alone at night, you know the type, she never happy
But I could make her smile, if she down to wait a while
'Cause after I get off of work, you know that I'ma take you out
Said, ""Goddamn, girl, that’s my spot""
And I don’t have to say it, but that thing you do, my favorite
And it stay in my thoughts

Don’t you ever in your whole life forget you are beautiful

Yeah, they told me, ""Don't make a promise you can't keep
All the drugs in your system, you can't sleep
How many times you had to buy a Plan B
For a girl you never bring back home to meet your family?"", man
Man, I swear it's what I dream about
Ever since my mom told me that she need me out
Always smokin' weed, causin' trouble, never clean the house
But I paid her back for everything; I guess we even now
Nothin' better than some head after a long day
That's the only thing that ever keep mine on straight
And she asked me, ""Why the long face?""
How I spent three-hundred-fifty dollars on this entrée
I drown my sorrow in that bottle
Today is full of regret, find forever in tomorrow
Man up, what's the problem?
Everything is Jazz and I'm Stockton (Haha)

Yeah
I know it seem a little bit strange sometimes
Yeah, yeah
Everybody live a little, everybody die
Yeah, yeah
But that's life
Whatchu gonna do?
That's life
Baby, I would spend it all witchu
 [Verse 2]
Yeah, and I'm headed to the
Other side, where the grass is always greener
And your bitch is down to ride, but that ass is always meaner
See, my cash got deeper and my morals disappeared
Never thought I'd be a asshole, this my last show
Can I please get a standin' ovation?
A hundred naked bitches in my dressin' room waitin'
We lost a lot of blood for this fucked up nation
But me, I'm gettin' high, makin' love in that spaceship
So what are the basics? Tell me your problems
You losin' your job or, even worse, you don't got one
So hard to stay sober when you feelin' fucked over so much
Always comin' up short, you like the roach of a blunt, yeah
And I could never sleep at night
Fuck payin' bills, I need a brand new lease on life
Why does doin' wrong always feel so right?
Well, I guess, fuck it, that's life

Yeah
I know it seem a little bit strange sometimes
Yeah, yeah
Everybody live a little, everybody die

Bored of waitin' at the door, you gon' walk away unless I let you in
Be careful what you wish for

Nobody ever see that side of me, I'd like to keep it that way
I'm not lyin', I just want somethin' that's mine
Don't need to share everything, I swear, life is just easy that way
You the only thing that's keepin' me sane, there goes my brain
So when I'm feelin low, I don't let it show
My ego won't let you see me that way

I wanna find the feelin' 'fore it's gone, it's takin' too long
Made me feel alright when I'm wrong, did you wrong, but

Even when you hurtin', always worried, losin' sleep because
The only thing you ever believed in was you and me, but

And this one to the homies that been with me through the thick and thin
We 'bout the same shit, just some synonyms
And we grew up in the city that we livin' in
Now we travel, tryna see the world from its different ends
We was some young boys, tryna hustle kids up in the middle school
Stuck in detention, writin' letters to our principal
And now the world gettin' real
Real and we try and do this shit without a deal
Don't ever want to go a single day without a meal
Meal 'cause we hungry, out to get a mill' like steel
When there's a will, there's a way
If this rappin' don't work, then we still gettin' paid
Just watch my back like always
And tell me if it's one of my off days
Keep me hazed up, you know, the same stuff
Just more money, makin' less part-ays
And these other teams soft like parfaits
While we racin' to the finish like a car chase
Dodgin' obstacles, together we can conquer the impossibles
Why these hoes spyin'? We call 'em Kim Possibles

Here to rock the cradle

Imagine that, I keep it in my circle like a key ring
Y'all some bee stings, chicken six-piece wing that I'm eating
Beat me? You must be dreaming
See, in this life, it seems all pretend
Get fucked up, go and grab a bottle of some Hen'
We drink it and we drink it 'til we fallin' on the bed
Go to sleep, wake up, and do it all again
If a girl try and play me, my homies let me know
You got to watch closely with these hoes
'Cause some is keepers, and some ain't
Always a bitch's birthday, she want cake
Dudes want to be down with my team but it's too late
'Cause now I got my peoples and we straight

I’ve traveled around the globe, done a thousand shows
Designer laundry, that’s a real expensive pile of clothes
I’m on the internet a lot, my life surrounds my phone
To be honest, been a while since I was out my home
This like the motherfucking day that Caesar found the throne
If you don’t call me king, I’ll gladly throw you out of Rome
A gangster in my mind, I think I’m Al Capone
A lot of real esate around that I’m about to own
Before you count your dough, you better count your blessings
I get a thousand questions all about the style I’m dressing
And all about complexion, you say I’m white?
Thank god for you, cause I forgot, you saved my life!
Me and your favorite rapper, probably ain’t alike
I’m with the thugs at the track, and we racing bikes

For real, I’m kinda just, making it all up right now
There’s a bad bitch in here, tell her buss it down
Tell her hush, she in my ear with all these “fuck me” sounds
I was (?), I guess I’m ugly now
So shout out those to you who stuck around through Funkytown
Now things are getting weird, I guess I’m kinda zany
‘Cause I drink my water right out of the Allegheny
I’m smoking loud, why you cheifing (?)
It’s good for you, like that Gerberts that they feed the babies
Tryna make me crazy, Jesus need to save me
Before I fuck around and end up deep in Hade’
I’m feeling good right now, please don’t worry about me
With these raps is gonna be a lot murders around me
How it feels to be you, I couldn’t word it proudly
I was lost, until the circus found me
Hoes from Orange County, that’s my favorite type
Grab some liquor and some weed, we can make a night
Break the law, the kids just ain’t alright
At least I met a bitch at the parade tonight

At least I met a bitch at the parade tonight
At least I met a bitch at the parade tonight
At least I met a bitch at the parade tonight

You know Sap, I told you I’d get you on an album man, how was I not going to do that?
Shit
Nah fuck that I ain’t done man, my fucking raps are ill man

I’m a motherfucking rapper man, I got raps
What you think, who do I look like?
Some who wouldn’t have raps? You crazy?
When you look at me, you see someone who doesn’t have raps man?
All I got is raps, and more raps, and raps on top of those raps
A lot of raps going on, motherfuckers be rapping
Rappers do, thats what rappers have always done
Motherfuckers are rapping, rappity, rap
And I wrap circles around these raps motherfucker too
Because y’all rap motherfuckers can’t even really rap, you just rap songs and-
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it

Don't stay behind (Don't stay behind)
'Cause love is nothin' easy
Come on, just in time
I know someone somewhere needs me
So when we get around to it
I hope you're ready, ooh, I hope you're ready
For when we get down to it
Get down, get down, get down, get down

[Verse 1]
Don't, don't miss out on love
Don't think about all the things that could happen
Nothin' really ever mattered but us, yep
Times gets tough and lines get crossеd, like fingers when wе lyin', so
All I know's look out below
Not too shallow to dive in your skin (Skin), so thin (So thin), mm
Carefully, I swim, but it feels so good when I'm all the way in
Nothin' else that I felt makes sense, yep

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ever in your goddamn life
Blink and miss the chance to see this shit go right, go right

[Chorus]
Don't stay behind (Don't stay behind)
'Cause love is nothin' easy
Come on, just in time
I know someone somewhere needs me
So when we get around to it (Get around to it)
I hope you're ready, ooh, I hope you're ready
For when we get down to it (We get down to it)
Get down, get down, get down, get down
 [Verse 2]
Yep, you the whole dream and I proceed
You can know me, make our own team, I will never be lonely
Ain't a need for nothin' but us
Lovin' just how we function, so what's the rush?
End up where you're goin'
How's your schedule? Can you keep it open?
I need you more than I need the moment
You shine, you golden, you deep as the ocean
Oh, and your skin (Skin) so thin (So thin)
If you don't mind, I'll jump right in
In all my years, I ain't never know
Intellect that connect like a telephone

[Pre-Chorus]
So no, don't you ever in your goddamn life
Worry you ain't gonna be alright, alright

[Chorus]
Don't stay behind (Don't stay behind)
'Cause love is nothin' easy
Come on, just in time
I know someone somewhere needs me
So when we get around to it (Get around to it)
I hope you're ready, ooh, I hope you're ready
For when we get down to it (We get down to it)
Get down, get down, get down, get down

You see the look in my eyes, it never change
I traveled around the world, but only use half my brain
This light illuminatin' the night, they throwin' shade

So leave me be and be yourself

You know who I am, see what I've done
I already got plenty, go get you one"

Ayo, ridin' by myself with my subs on blast
Rollin' up and facin' out a puff-puff-pass
Got a trunk full of new clothes, pocket full of cash
She a girl with no booty, throw McDonald's on that ass
We out for one thing and one thing only
Fill the truck up with some women, one for every single homie
When they see me buyin' bottles, they say, ""Holy guacamole, how old is he?
This seems fishy,"" then they stop, and I throw cheese
No peas, but my engine already runnin'
I'm tellin' 'em that it's nothin', she yellin' now that she laughin'
Tryna push me, I ain't budgin' though, headin' to another show
Duffel bag with me and I fill it with a bunch of dough and pass it to my team
Eatin' five-star cuisine, yes, our lives are a dream
So decide if you might be apart of big things that we doin' every day
Got these bitches on my dick, so I give 'em lemonade, ayy

Yeah, you doin' shows, but you do 'em for way cheaper
You need her, I freak her and leave her
Have me like, ""Hot damn,"" how they offerin' the beaver

I'm one year, you three weeks
That's why you with your girl, waitin' in line to meet me
Just to say, ""What's up?"" and pass my homie off your CD
Completely I'm eating every time I'm speaking

Lead singer came with Keith Richards, brought the band along
I'm pretty Zen lady, headspin is 1080
They say that I went crazy but love me when the check cleared
Red beard, seen into the future, fear the end near
Bitch I want it all, I will not give you not a cent here
This is not pretend, I'm trying to pay some pricy rent here

Do the most, I'm the host and the special guest here
It's a fucking party started, everybody get weird
Take your pants off, move your body, you can dance around
I got you shitting in your pants, you wearing Pampers now

On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys, they were up to no good
They started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said ""You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, Holmes, to Bel-Air!""

But it's great 'cause I love hate
So listen, fuck-face, I'm givin' news, hip-hop updates
You want music and all that fly?
You better do it like Motor and blog or die

Cuttin' up more than your everyday person

Puttin' hip-hop on smash
Exclusives, pictures, everyone can see me

Yeah, I keep the scene fresh, HipHopDX
Sometimes I wonder what this music gon' be next
V-necks to baggy clothes, blowin' like alamo
Check the blogs, you can see the youngin has the flow
Balls like cockfights, jaws like dog bites
Daily check-up or nah, right?
And I see dope, got me three phones, haha
I leak tracks like Leak Jones
So check how I'm rippin' you, you other cats is pitiful
From East Coast to the Midwest, digital
Bars like cells and I'm armed well, yeah
With new music in my cartel

I got splash and low-key heard that new
Oh, new Mac Miller? Yeah, I heard that too
So if I forgot to say your blog and you showin' love
I'm so high, you can blame it on the bud
But I love all y'all, man

Good luck, everybody
Keep puttin' up that free music

Yeah, one more beat?
Yeah, yeah
I um, woke up early this morning
That's very rare
But, I felt like I haven't slept, in a while
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Forever invincible with the infinite flow
Crackin' the DaVinci code, I play the game on difficult
Could've been the G.O.A.T, but I blew it like a piccolo
My bitch alone in the bed, she feelin' miserable
I got my flaws too, locked inside this dark room
And I ain't no photographer, I'm something like a carpenter
Full of broken promises, I said I'd build a rocket for
Her to fly away in but she'd never come back
Lord knows that she's hard to faze, got a soft spot for her
She agitated in this maze, I am lost for words
You don't need binoculars to see the monikers
Gettin' popular, it feels a bit twisted, word to Oliver
Lyin' pathologically, smile at the comedy
I only sleep with a song playin' on repeat
Tryna do the right thing, I hope that poppy sees
Girl, lovin' you is all I really need
 [Chorus]
Girl, don't be scared of your nightmares
You can close your eyes, I'll be right there
I ain't perfect, but I'm learning
The firewood stay burning all night
And don't give up, things will be alright
Come and dance with me like it was prom night
It's one-thousand eight-hundred twenty days I count
That me and you been playing house (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I still remember making out on Jenny's couch
You gave me one more kiss before you let me out
Couldn't spend a day without each other, wouldn't separate
Lost in conversation, having sex could wait a week or two
In my daddy's car, talking 'til the sun came up
You slept at your moms but you text me when you wake up
Quickly came love, the pain led to break ups
You hated it, it made you sick, every time I take drugs
It's all my fault, over-dramatic, always actin' suicidal
You call me on my lies though
If love were a religion, you wrote the Bible
Wanna grow old together and watch the time go
And I would give it all back
Before I lost you again, no, I don't want that
Just wait for me, let me take my time
I'm all yours, baby, rain or shine, yeah
 [Chorus]
Girl, don't be scared of your nightmares
You can close your eyes, I'll be right there
I ain't perfect, but I'm learning
The firewood stay burning all night
And don't give up, things will be alright
Come and dance with me like it was prom night
It's one-thousand eight-hundred twenty days I count
That me and you been playing house (Yeah)

[Outro]
I know the thought of forever is kinda scary
But, baby, we should get married
Give you a baby you can carry
Our love will never be ordinary
Can you pour one more Bloody Mary?
Can you pour one more Bloody Mary?
One more"

Good mornin' (Mornin', mornin')

Yeah, wake up in God we trust
I pour some liquor in my coffee cup, I roll the weed and spark it up
This sober life is not for us, it's all because I got's to bust
Like havin' sex with Playmates
She wanna have some lunch tomorrow, can't afford my day rate
(Well, well, well)
No apologies, it's me, my money and astronomy
I wake up like this crazy life might kill me
I'm tryna to change the world, they busy tryna take a selfie
I'm so deep inside this hole
There's no one down enough to help me
Other than Hell, I be's the hottest
But I make it snow in August, don't proceed with caution
Loose cannon, Hulk shit, I'm Bruce Banner (Banner, Banner)
The way the music hit you like the room dancin'
Me and my dawgs, we hungry, must be a huge famine
Crib in the Hampton's, one right out in Malibu
Pays to be an artist, it all started on Penn Ave
Yeah, the volume up, the sound is drownin' you (Drownin' you, drownin' you)
I just gotta lay back and (And, and, and)

I roll some weed and blow my mind away (Way, way), yeah

I pray to God she help me find my way

[Verse 2]
Yeah, before I started, regarded as one of the hardest in the yard
No money from a job, I was distracted by these broads
She said, ""You want that pussy? Then walk the plank,"" and
I dove into that ocean, I saw her naked in the Hall of Angels
Chasin' lion, tigers, caught a Bengal
Best finagle the bagel, ready, willin', and able
Fillin' ya cable with destructions, spontaneous combustion
Alien abductions, plus what the fucks in
Platinum plus rappers
Say ""Hi"" when you see me, won't be say nothing after
I'm a motherfuckin' bastard, uh
Master of disguise, word to the wise, don't fuck with me
You the rich and comfortably, we out back, dungaree
Motherfucker please don't even think to try me
My mind is somewhere else, they pumpin' ""crazy"" in my IV, yeah
You either with me or behind me, from up here the world look tiny, shit

I roll some weed and blow my mind away
Find the shit I'm tryna say, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away
I pray to God he help me find my way, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hey, I got these Ray-Ban shades
Kinda look like somethin' Lennon would rock
It seems like now I got a couple bags whenever I shop
Louis shoes, Polo socks, some name brand dumb shit
Logo never make a man, but I'm still blowin' thousands on it
No clue what I'm callin' my album
Fans be at my van screamin', callin' me Malcolm
Never knew the outcome be this much cash now
Bank account lookin' like a George Jung stash house
Young and actin' out, the topics that I rap about
Be varyin' from politics to bitches pullin' asses out
That's exactly how I do this as a rapper
I'm nuttin' in her mouth, you tongue kissin' her after
Daughters' moms kinda want me neutered
But they also want the kid to cum right on they cooter
Have the music soundin' better than guitar tuners
Plus I'm doin' shows daily, call me Jon Stewart
So who you know that's iller than Mac Miller and company?
It's like I planted money seeds right underneath the fuckin' tree
Now I got a hundred G's, so none of y'all can fuck with me
Yeah, I said it publicly, so run and tell your mother, motherfucker
I said run and tell your mother, motherfucker
 [Interlude]
Hold up, Jerm, let me spit the second

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I breeze past haters in the E-Class quickly
In deep, did a hundred songs and that’s this week
Shit keeps goin' on and on
We just tryna go bananas like it's Donkey Kong, yeah
On my grind, always need to work
So I be eatin' good, you be eatin' dirt
If you talkin' shit, you gon' see me smirk
While the DJ be scratchin' 'til the needles burst
A couple screws probably loose in my head
Holler at my girl, tell her bring that doobie to bed
I'm a regular guy with an irregular life
Except I'm a Lamborghini if it's racin' a bike
Who knew that I can turn-turn sound into somethin' so cool?
Fresh kids, see me, I'm bustin' the moves
Comin' out soon to a theater near you
Creep in your kitchen, start eating your food
Girls tryna fuck, I don't be in the mood
No time for pussy when money in the room, ooh
I switch flows, switch rhythm
Sick spittin', unlimited ammunition, hey

Uh, [?], what up?
East End Empire all day, you know
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
See, I'm one of a kind
There's a brain behind all these different wonderful rhymes
And peoples livin' in the past 'cause they runnin' from time (Uh)
Seems like so long since Big Punisher died
Hope he see me when I'm lookin' up from under the sky (Yup)
I'ma tell you how it is 'cause I got nothin' to hide
And Soul Theory makes the beats that'll bump in the ride (Uh-huh)
This criminal lifestyle that I'm jumpin' inside
A mastermind, superb with both sides of his brain
Roll me up into a Swisher, start flyin' away
But ash my soul, rub the L on the side of the tray
'Cause it's hard lookin' up, like the sky when it rains (Uh-huh)
Smokin' strains that levitate me like David Blaine
I'm a player and you hatin' on my game
Say my name, 'cause this here's my destiny, child
Now all this stress is off of my chest, I can rest for a while
 [Chorus]
Just roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up)
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back, and got you feelin' so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin' so high
Got me feelin' so, feelin' so, with this blunt of my mind

[Verse 2]
And I shall not (Uh-huh), hold thy tongue
So I'ma speak 'til I fold my gums
I was told to run (Run), 'cause every day is a colder one
I wake up not knowin' if I'm old or young
I can't (Can't), find my place so I lay upon these beats (Beats)
Coverin' my pain with layers of melodic sheets (Uh-huh)
Mother Earth's a bitch, so when kingdom come
We gon' bring 'em some 'til thy will be done
And still to come is when I'm finally driven to insanity
By my family, who never seemed to be a fan of me
My knees are shakin', see, I'm not able to stand
'Cause they label a man by his paper in hand
Sittin' in a dark alley with some paper and pens
Writin', just thinkin' when this day's gon' end
What can you say to a man who can't look at himself
When the image in the mirror keeps on yellin' for help? (Uh-huh)
 [Chorus]
Just roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up)
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back, and got you feelin' so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin' so high
Got me feelin' so, feelin' so (Uh), with this blunt of my mind (Yeah, I'm)

[Verse 2]
Hip-hop's child, you feel me do the touchin'
Spittin' got me smitten, no excuses for the lovin' (Uh)
I'm tryna get it written but I'm comin' up with nothin'
A couple words in each line filled with somethin', somethin', somethings (Uh-huh)
And to me, hip-hop ain't got a criminal past
It's just explosions of sounds as these syllables clash
Brain on critical mass (Yup), fuck political trash (Yup)
These politicians speakin', but it's comin' out they ass
Talkin' bout ""School is cool"" and ""Drugs is for thugs""
Tryna push me down a path, but I shall not budge
'Cause I've been thinkin' and I think I have a hunch
Who hand the mic to get enough
While me and music makin' love
And my community ain't all about who I choose to be
This life and what it do to me, the ruined opportunities
This figurative language that I'm speakin' so fluently
Look back like a photo album, seein' who I used to be (Chyeah)
Playin' piano and I'm strummin' guitar
Can't buy myself a spaceship so I'm runnin' to Mars
Stare at death in the face, like I'm under a car (Uh-huh)
It ain't everybody hatin', but enough of you are

Just roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up)
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back, and got you feelin' so fine

Now here lies a great man, a man of the people
A man of the people, people (Yeah, oh)

Yeah, here he comes, it's the highly unprofessional, hypersexual intellectual
Fried my brain, now I've become a vegetable
Travel with a gang of weird lookin' extraterrestrials (Mi-mi-mi-mi)
They let me on their ship and made their bitches call me ""General""
The dick quake could make a bitch shake like she got Parkinson's
You out there politickin', I'm studyin' Darwinism (God)
I keep some bars and hit 'em like a hard collision (Bang)
Don't fuck around, it's murder in this art exhibit
And I got the whole game on paralyzed 'cause my volume on amplified
You slow as a biracial bitch that's waitin' on her hair to dry (I don't wanna go yet)
Are you prepared to die? Burnin' this Ameri-fry
Where people that protect you are the ones that have you terrified
I only act this way 'cause my soul so broken
I'm the illest that you know, you a low-dose Motrin
Laryngitis, hepatitis, the AIDS virus
I guess that's what you get from bein' 'round a bunch of rat vaginas
And you (And you), you pussy I wouldn't fuck with a drunk dick
The day I came back from bein' hostage to the Russian mob
Missin' a finger and see my brother shot (Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
I'm comin' for your neck, so hide your head inside your mother's box (Motherfucker)
It still ain't cliche to say, ""Fuck the cops"" (No)
Let's try it (Fuck the cops)
'Cause I just smoked a bunch of rocks and walked around in just my socks
And made myself a birthday cake with caramel and butterscotch

This life carries a price cheaper than clown feet
Like prostitutes with hoops and combined weaves
Who hates herself inside
So she sellin' her punani by umami (ooh mind me?)
It's like my soul's inside the bowl
I hold it close, 'cause I don't know when it's my time to go
I'm blindin' fold, I hear my son laughin' and time is froze
And he knows it, lookin' at me like ""That's my pops,"" and I'm his goal, nigga
Motherfucker, I hit pockets, pickpockets
I'll beat you for your keys, bubblegum, and your bitch wallet
To his product, I'm a prodigy of a dead nigga
No name droppin', scribin' when nobody was dead meat when they came flockin'
Brain doctorin', where I left my hard dates
Small shakes and small dates, the ones I only call late in parlay
You know what the dark say (Say), grab a bitch by the paw, ayy (Ayy)
Her name's Autumn, she happens to be fallin' on the wrong day

Unleash the beast, freak beats and keep comin'
Nasty but we spit it so sincerely
Drip phlegm from the pen so they can feel me

Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay, it don't stop 'til I say so
Got this shit on lock just like I'm callin' from payphones
They know, pray to God I don't break
Before I plant a seed and watch it grow to a flower that I can put in a vase
You see the look on my face, it's no jokes
It's hard to see it clear here with so much smoke
And pops said I'm gon' go broke if I don't fix myself (Self)
I said, ""I'd rather kill myself"", oh well (Well)
Hello, hello, live here from Melrose
It's divine, in the nick of time, self-loathin', hell no
Turn on your speakers and silence your cell phones
'Cause you 'bout to witness the best in the business (Business)
Only fuck with myself though
I swear the bullshit is up to my elbows
So take that, take that
Yo' bitch ass gon' need a Six Flags day pass to ride like this
You gon' need to fly fish to catch a vibe like this
'Cause you ain't ever gettin' high like this (You better choose the right fix)
I'ma shoot, I might miss
But when we hoop, it's like, ""Swish""
I'm in a coupe doin' loops, drivin' really nice whips
Hold the game in tight fists, lay back and light spliffs
All day and night shifts, I know they really like this (Woah)
You can't see me anymore
Playin' on advanced, it ain't easy anymore (No way)
Only real ones is walkin' on my floors
You can bet we checkin' cards at the door (Yeah)
 [Chorus: Mac Miller]
There's no time like the present, no line I ain't steppin' over, that ain't gonna change
I'm leavin' for a second, I'll be back before you notice that I ever went away
I don't wanna be in this world without it
I've gotta keep it a thousand
And if I'm sleepin', usually in the mountains
All I see is clouds every time I look down

Get high, breakin' laws
Get high, breakin' laws

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay, I wake up with the taste of pussy still in my mouth
Bitch in my bed, homegirl still asleep on the couch
My head is bangin' like Metallica, swallow a bottle of Advil up
Then head back to the bedroom where she suck me dry like Dracula
It's The Young Miraculous, Mister Love-to-Grab-His-Nuts
Never let a bitch inside, fuck her in the Acura
Aurora borealis with the shine, my aura gorgeous
Dinner with forty courses, bunch of horny whores
Who fornicate to formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses, I am
My homies got my back, they all Verizon (A-a-a-and?)
I bring this to you la-la-la-la-la-la-live, man
You gon' need at least five hands to hold my finance
I am fe, fi, fo, fum, the giant
The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates
I tell 'em, ""Shh, this middle finger sign for silence""
Ain't a fuckin' way I'm keepin' quiet

So many people told me that I wouldn't be shit
But now I walk around with money and my hand on my dick
I think I'm special (Special), I'm drinkin' whiskey out the bottle 'til I black out
One million, two million, shit, I'm losin' track now
(Yeah) Comin' to you live inside the crack house
Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce
Then I turned it to a pound (Wow), turned that to a house (Wow)
Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here? (Woo)
Spendin' all your time just gettin' high will drive you crazy
(Crazy) I killed the game like Jeffrey Dahmer did the '80s
Speedin' down the freeway gettin' head in my Mercedes
Givin' me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better, no pressure
Dope seller, smarter than your professor
Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller
The flow's stellar, stella ella ola, have you ever been?

Yeah, I put my cards all on the table
Nothin' playin' at the cinema, okay we watchin' cable
Some documentary that's in another language
You keep lookin' at your phone, I keep on trying to explain it
Like, why's it so important, I don't know why it's important
But my mind is open, I ain't high from smoking, I'm in orbit
I just want to be more intellectual
Where did your attention go? You so hyper sexual
That's not my intention, see the world is more dimensions
I want you to see them all, and follow up with all them questions
Fall in love with your reflection, just as I have
Your pussy in my direction, let me try that
Yeah, I got the universe in my bag, put it on the IMAX
And we can look at heaven through a time-lapse
Yeah baby you my Venus fly trap
I pick you from the garden, now you're sitting here on my lap

My room stay smokey, go outside for some clean air
All around the globe I see these bitches at my shows
Who invite me to their crib sayin' they twistin' up a O
Bunch of haters on the internet
Trust me, I ain't finished yet
I'ma take care of all of y'all like a Giga Pet
People say I'm dead, I tell 'em that they just ain't livin' yet
Excess weed, alcohol, hoes, and cigarettes

Spendin' all this money like, ""Fuck it"" (Uh-huh)
The Jew who never budget

Now they loadin' up to shoot, I'm in the open for your view
Not duckin' and dodge, and I tell 'em, ""Fuck it, I'm walkin'""
And if they come with a problem, I'ma smile, tell 'em, ""Go 'head""
You got no bread, worry what your ho said
Think about the dream that you chasin', don't lose focus
Progress, no stress, whatever happen, happen
I'm laughin' when we passin' 'cause my raps is bringin' cash in
I got a job, a career, I'm the talk of the year
Look at myself and I fog up the mirror
I'm hot and you not, you don't got what I brought
To the table, to the fans you just basic cable

Said, they don't know my bitch's name, no, no
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
I'm, wakin' up from this coma
Called her on the mobile phone
Askin' her if she's goin' home
Or she's still sleepin' over
I mighta lost my fragile soul
I could probably use a loaner
No emotion, playin' poker
Once I moved to California
She lost a lot of that trust in me
Can't say she don't get a rush when she fuckin' me
Subsequently, I'm prayin' to a angel
Where did all the pain go?
So unstable, the cocaine is on the table
 [Bridge]
Girl, let's take off, let's get out of here
Goin', goin', a different atmosphere awaits us
I tend to talk a lot, and you don't say much
But everything I say just ain't enough, no
Say I need to let that love show
You knock me down so fast, I'm gettin' up slow
Yeah, everything ain't perfect
Standin' there on judgment day, like was it all worth it? Uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Never had a lot, but I made a lot
They told a story, I changed the plot
Now I'm savin' up for that plane or yacht
Them extra channels, that cable box, yeah
I'm faithful to that cable box
That money good, but that pain is not
They said, ""Damn, you changed a lot,"" but

[Chorus]
They don't know my bitch's name
Said, they don't know my bitch's name
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe, whoa, whoa
Said, they don't know my bitch's name
Said, they don't know my bitch's name, no, no
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe, whoa, whoa"

Yeah
Hello, happiness
Hello, honeymoon
Hello, passionate love, where the fuck was you?
I been waitin' all my life just for you
Am I in love with you, or am I just confused?
Baby, you was the one to come save me
Tell the world I wasn't crazy
But lately, your mind just isn't here no more
What did I do?
You not a bitch, just always angry
But it's so difficult to hate me
I'm the closest thing to home you'll ever know

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, why you so mad at me?
Let you have all of my love and it's still not enough, shit
Why you so hard to please?
Gave you every single part of me
You're never satisfied
Satisfied
Never satisfied
Satisfied
Yeah
 [Verse 2]
Hello for the night, it ain't complicated
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, ain't no obligation
Not a single string attached, this ain't a puppet show
You didn't want to fall in love, you made her come and go
Yeah, she was only here so I forget her
And be distracted by the pleasure
It's way too painful to remember
So I get faded and pretend it's all good
And when I'm underneath the weather
Tryin' to keep my shit together
I never surrender

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, why you so mad at me?
Let you have all of my love and it's still not enough, shit
Why you so hard to please?
Gave you every single part of me
You're never satisfied

Never satisfied

Da-dun, da-da-dun, da

[Verse 1]
Yeah, all the days go away, so I put myself on payroll
My God, anything you need, I got
Never let you get these thoughts, 'cept now
Well, more money, less smiles
I know the way it goes, when it goes, and then it goes around
Swear to God I've been stressed, they don't wanna clean up this mess I make
Oh well, only left with myself, and I'm straight
I'm wired, but tired, I drain the supplier
I keep it so cool, somehow still beyond fire
Don't tempt me, I could break, thе mistake be deadly
Camе for the Rangers, Bentleys, M3s, all the bullshit I'ma get me
Somethin' like a, like a dream I once knew
Hustle to the trouble, what they lead me right to
And before the night's through, you put me in the right mood
Swear that I'll return the favor if I get the chance to
But don't worry 'bout it, always in a hurry, always trippin'
I've been missin' times when all I did was kick it with
With no plan, with no plan, with no plan
My younger self is probably lookin' at me like an old man
I give way too many fucks, don't keep enough for myself
It's no drugs, but your love got me under a spell
When I'm a hundred and twelve and still kickin'
Questionin' my existence, wonderin' how the fuck I done made it
I went the distance, will you, will you tell me the truth?
Don't make a difference, yeah, any minute I may piss it away
 [Chorus]
Pick me up, don't slip
Don't drop me, don't shoot me, don't miss
Let it go, don't you ever go with it
Yeah, don't lie, lie down
I've been high, high ground
Now I try to keep myself (Yeah) calm

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't go
Tellin' me somethin' I probably already know
Carryin' weight, countin' mistakes, I know I'm wrong
Another song just so I have somethin' I can put on to fall asleep to
Thoughts creep through, so uninvited, I swear I know what to do
For some reason, I wanna fight it, that's righteous
I'm feelin' slighted, and missin' my vices
More than twice, that's overthinkin' and turnin' down all my brightness
I just wanna let it go so bad
Finally float above the fortunate
Married to the game 'til I'm divorcin' it
She tell me that my mind is danger, yeah
Keep lookin' at me like I'm a stranger
Just for now, there's nothin' holy hangin' by the manger
Human nature, I look inside me, all I find is anger, yeah
It's all worth it 'cause nervous was never my behavior
I'm tired of tankerin', fly away up as high as rain
I don't feel so bad
It's no magic, pull rabbits out of my hat
They lookin' for me, I'm exactly that
 [Chorus]
Pick me up, don't slip
Don't drop me, don't shoot me, don't miss
Let it go, don't you ever go with it

[Verse]
I probably should've put this dream on layaway
I woke up in a frenzy, today's the day
I threw the function, bitches drunk off the Tanqueray
Now she got me in handcuffs, slap me and tell me to say her name
That bitch got a crazy brain, but everything a-okay
She a really good time, besides, that pussy is ace of spades
I wake up with a hangover, she already makin' eggs
I call her on my layover, she send pictures, spreadin' legs
Goddammit, this life of minе
Should've been a superhero somеwhere out fightin' crime
Instead I was lightin' my weed
Gettin' Eiffel high, the tower that is
My girlfriend appreciate the gifts I shower her in
You see, 2010 was the year that I made it
But lookin' back on it now, that shit be feelin' so ancient
I get to crackin' a smile, I got 'em fiendin' put the crack in the vial
Stir a ruckus like the cat that's chasin' after the mouse
We be breakin' all the glass in the house
Friday was crazy, but it's Saturday now (Yeah)
I keep the glass half-full, the whisky bottle empty
Give praises to the most high, 'cause somebody up there bless me
It's nice bein' a millionaire but sometimes it's depressin'
We keep eatin' so much seafood, I'm just in the mood for Wendy's
I'm so regular, see?
It's crystal-clear insanity, that's ADHD
And I grew up with delinquents, we would play in the street
'Til it was late, causin' trouble while the neighborhood sleep
Runnin' away from police
What do we get older for? I wish I was only four
I wish I was sober more, but no, I be overboard
I'm sinkin' with my ship until it sit on the ocean floor
It's four in the mornin', I'm up and horny, downloadin' porn
I see the lies with eagle eye vision
We inside a dream of mine, we'll redefine livin'
All I need a television and some weed, I'm fine, chillin'
I'm hotter than a oven makin' pizza in your kitchen
Better keep your eyes peeled and open
Hit a blunt in the whip, tryna stunt with a bitch in the front
And a fifth I'ma sip 'til I'm sick and I'm drunk
I ain't givin' a fuck, yeah, I've been in a funk
Now I live like a pimp, into business stuff
A magician to tricks, make a bitch disappear like her boyfriend comin' to the game
Pay up like the first of the month, I'ma take what I want
Everybody need somethin', shit
If this my last day on this Earth, tell the kids to write my name in the dirt (Immortal)
Cup full of liquor, mind full of bad ideas
The club closed, why the fuck are we the last ones here?
How I'm gettin' home? Who is callin' the place?
God don't recognize me, he must have forgotten my face
Find my way in this strange world
Strange, strange world we live in
And I'ma leave this bitch lifted"

People holla when they see me, say, ""What's up, Mac?"" (What up?)
Young crap, I ain't tryna touch that
Dumbass cops here, fuck that, always wanna cuff Mac
Run tracks and I'm done fast (Done fast)
Got you right under my nose like a mustache
Y'all rodents, muskrats, stuck like a thumb tack
Foot tap, you could see me up where the funk at (Haha)
Take a little time, come and check the rhyme
And this just some lyrical exercise
Tryna stay in shape like a polygon, it's on
Hoes stay obsessed, always call me when I'm gone
""Can you come over?"", ""I'm busy, it's important""
""What could you be doin' at five in the mornin'?""
""Um, um, recordin', doin' shit for Class Clown""
""Well, who is that girl in the background?""
""Haha, you caught me, I guess you got me""
I just can't keep 'em off me, they somethin' like the paparazzi
Goin' for the kill like a kamikaze (Haha)
No clothes ever on her body, haha
Your whole team gotten on her probably
She always seem like she on the molly
But, hey, I'm just a boy, I'm sorry

Well, well, well, well
Hello, baby
Well, well, well, well
Hello, baby

[Chorus]
I try to stay humble but it's hard when you this fly
Women want a picture witcha, hand the camera to their guy
And I know that they just wanna pose with the kid
So my clothes stayin' fresh and my dome gettin' big (Gettin' big)
So many stars above me, they don't mention me (Mention me)
But it's hard when you feel like a celebrity (Celebrity)
When you feel like a celebrity, oh, woah (Woah)
When you feel like a celebrity (Uh, look)

[Verse 1]
My homie try and tell me that my mac ain't well
Lean back with a laugh and half a smile
Wanna have a good time but I gotta hard grind
And I gotta go back right now
The way these people be lovin', it's hard to comprehend
Every time I go out, out into public
Feel like the boy got a lot of friends
Shit, I don't want it to end, bro
Be back up in the crib smokin', playin' Nintendo
‘Cause, me, I’m tryin' be up at the Grammys
Throwin' parties in Miami
Round the bend of Venice Beach, recognize me in the streets
With a hundred thousand women rockin' all expensive linen
Livin' life like it's a dream, I can't wait to be the king
Shit, I don't want it to ever end
But for you bitches, it's somethin' I wouldn't recommend

I try to stay humble but it's hard when you this fly
Women want a picture witcha, hand the camera to their guy
And I know that they just wanna pose with the kid

So many stars above me, they don't mention me (Mention me)
But it's hard when you feel like a celebrity (Celebrity)
When you feel like a celebrity, oh, woah (Woah)
When you feel like a celebrity (Uh, look, uh)

[Verse 2]
Comin' back with a vengeance
Take a breath in the pause right after the sentence
Uh, go and hit your L, uh
Now back to the business, uh, with a round of applause
Got shorty right down to her draws
Don't mess around with the best around
When it's gonna come down to the bars
They gotta know I'm, I'm so high
Ask me, boy, I won't lie
My body’s stuck on ghost ride
Throw a toast to the most high
I don't need your co-sign
If you don't like me, then fuck you
But don't try and say, ""What's up?"" when you come through (Come through)
'Cause I don't need you, man
The boy done gained a heap of fans
A hundred-fifty downloads in a minute when I leak a jam
The future of this music shit, well, homie, I believe I am
'Cause every time I rock a mic, they get up out their seats like, ""Damn""
 [Chorus]
I try to stay humble but it's hard when you this fly
Women want a picture witcha, hand the camera to their guy
And I know that they just wanna pose with the kid

Okay, your legs just like a store, they open up and you got people in line
Been there every night for weeks at a time
You in my dreams, that's why I sleep all the time
Just to hear you say ""I love you,"" just to touch you, just to leave you behind
I told you, you don't have to worry, you'll be fine
This type of thing, I heard it happen all the time, yeah
I just wanna see you fly
Because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high
Said nothin' better than the first time
I'll be at your service like the check-in at the curbside
You don't have to spend another second on this Earth dry
Wet you like a fresh pool, go a second and a third time
Left you a perverse mind
And when you hungry, I can chef you up a stir fry
Get you some dessert wine, elevate your third eye
First prize, Nobel, get a piece
Your clothes off, turn around, lemme see

Okay, I came up with a plan, it was
Take you by the hand and bring you somewhere where the sand is
Soon as we landed, we went straight into the room and played the music
Started dancin', you was takin' off your pants
It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore, I do you like a chore
We started on the bed and then we movin' to the floor
You started gettin' crazy, told me fuck you like a whore
I thought you was an angel, now you yellin' to the Lord
You used to tell me all the time I ain't ya type
Now you always wanna spend the night
Now I'm doin' everything you like
When I'm inside your pussy, damn, it feels so right (Yeah)
But I still respect ya game
Every time I'm outta line, you always set me straight
The sex is great, for Heaven's sakes, I need it every day
I yell your name, Cinderella
Never gonna find nobody better, all my life

Been meanin' to tell ya, you lookin' better every day

Well, this is what it look like right before you fall
Stumblin' around, you've been guessin' your direction
Next step, you can't see at all
And I don't have a name, I don't have a name, no
Who am I to blame? Who am I to blame though?
And I cannot be changed, I cannot be changed, no
Trust me, I've tried
I just end up right at the start of the line
Drawin' circles
Mmm

[Verse 2]
Well, I drink my whiskey and you sip your wine
We're doing well, sittin', watchin' the world fallin' down, its decline
And I can keep you safe, I can keep you safe, mmm
Do not be afraid, do not be afraid
You're feelin' sorry, I'm feelin' fine
Don't you put any more stress on yourself, it's one day at a time

Pure bliss
I knew that we would stay together, we in cursive

Infatuation
When every single move you make is fascinatin'
Gravitatin'
Towards anything that gives a sense of happiness
Activist, love activist
Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists
Hope you found what you lookin' for
I hope you find what you lookin' for

You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm payin' you back
I'ma be waitin' for that
I'ma be waitin' for that

[Verse 3]
Misery
You represent love, you the epitome
So wish for me
I'll come out of nowhere—your epiphany
Disconnect
From everybody who don't understand my vision yet
In a jet
Is where my mind is, so I light another cigarette to calm me down

[Verse 4]
So calm me down
Everybody who can save me now is not around
Chopper down
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?
In between
Purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be
Live a dream
That's so cliché, but I can tell you what it means to me
 [Chorus]
You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm payin' you back
I'ma be waitin' for that

Next up, we have our last candidate for the 2010 Allderdice High School presidential campaign
We have Mac Miller!

[Verse]
Haha, look
Comin' with the flows of a veteran, Mac for class president
All black Letterman, recognize a gentleman (Uh-huh)
Know anything but formal, take you out the normal (Yeah)
It's time travel here, step into my portal
Never seem to be another ordinary college fellow
Still keep a bunch of action figures, Donatellos (Clever)
I used to wet my pants, leave the carpet yellow
Now I'm playin' games with hoes, turn they heart to Jell-O
L rolled from my wrist to my elbow
Hella smoke got my eyes red like Elmo
Music that I make got me buzzin' like a cellphone
Stickin' to my word, I'm Velcro (This kid's great)
Hell no, I ain't gon' stop one minute
Better than I ever been, before was just a scrimmage
Now the boy playin' for the cup, this the championship
See the wordplay dance from his lips
All my ladies, put your hands on your hip
Here's some candy to lick
Come and holla if your man is a bitch
Every party that I roll to they demand me to spit
Treat me like I'm Peyton Manning in this
Playa, I don't got no time for the slow grind here in '09
Blow minds with these dope rhymes, call 'em coke lines (Mac Miller)
Snort it, get distorted, I'm takin' you out of orbit
Plus we poppin' champagne, see the cork twist
Purple piff got me higher than a forklift
Hungry, feedin' like my mother got four tits
I'm livin' in this music, you a tourist
Rocky and Bulwinkle, you just Boris
Boy spit still way sharper than a swordfish
Your whole style just dead like a morgue is
I'm a senior but I stay fresh, man
Class president, never woulda guessed, man (Great)
Bitches on me that I ain't never met, man
The only thing that's on your dick is your left hand
Wolverine deal, signin' on the X, man
They don't hear me up in Def Jam

Oh, thank you, thank you Mac Miller, thank you
Hahaha, oh wow, oh, quite impressive

Fresh off a steroid swisher
Pistol at the peephole, that's a paranoid nigga
One of a kind though, ain't nobody close to me
Your ass is straight over D, I'll bag it like groceries
It's whatever though, whatever cross my mind
Haters got no watch, I ain't got the time
Vinny got more flow than a box of wine
Rare as a copper dime, I got an awkward mind
But it's beautiful like Russel Crowe
Fire at the fingertips, can't extinguish it
Shorty gave me tight head without shrinkin' it
Coolest kid out, on my Chuck Inglish shit
Mac and Vinny always get the people loose
Fall back, strike back, just like evil do
The birds prey on us like eagles do
It's like claymation the way they bend and move

Monster and Michael Keaton, I'm offin' you while you sleepin'
You talkin' but it's so cheap and I'm popular for a reason
I got a pool but it's sharks swimmin' in the deep end
Don't get much sleep, two minutes to get a dream in
Is all you need, it's crazy
The colony was lost at sea gettin' wavy
The rawest rapper, baby forehead autographer
On top of Saturn, I'm sendin' shots from a rocket blaster
Believe me, this is where geniuses live
It's Most Dope, we holier than all of Jesus' kids
But we speakin' to heathens and all of these Even Stevens
Who don't need a reason, just want a bitch they can feed with semen
No need for sleepin', cheeba gon' keep me dreamin', I'm faded
Been in Cali a lil' too long, it got me jaded
Hit Japan and I'm Instagrammin' camera-shy Samurais
Fuckin' up a Jerm beat, teach you how to vandalize
The bandana Santana tied
The sound amplified screams on Kennywood's Steel Phantom rides
My pockets fat, I'm still lookin' for some pants my size
They over-analyze everything I fantasize
We could have a conversation, we could pantomime
Girl, you could come a little closer, put your hand in mine
This life a prison, it's time to set you free
Watchin' movies in silence, describin' what I see

On the coffee shop, way too fucked up
Too high, I can touch the sky
My mom knows I rap but she still wonder why
I bring thunder, the odle from down under
Ha, like a video game, but really, you lame
The gat held, steady the aim, I'm ready as rain
You mad 'cause they picked me instead of you lames
Get some lead straight fed to your brain
And then I'm sendin' ya chains, it is the end of the game"

Girls playin' games for the bills, they Drew Bledsoe (Woah)
There's a lot that you can buy, but I'll never own
And a lot of information that I'll never know
Learn 'til they get concerned for my sanity
A life that's filled with vanity needs a little clarity (Clarity)
This the truth, this a taste, can you handle it?
A million dollars couldn't cover up the damages
Naked girl at the crib makin' sandwiches (Uh-huh)

Look at my hands, I'm the lord of the rings (Lord of the rings)
Musical cocaine brought me all of these Carrera keys
Soft top goin' hard on the block
Freeze that talk on them plots 'bout walkin' up on me
No security, just my homies, the well-dressed army
Presidential arm piece, my credentials: I'm a G (I'm a G)
All-access jets wherever you won't be
Snatch that 'Vette for my mans the day of his prison release
Shoe was on the other foot, I know he would've done the same thing for me
But we'll let that be
Park it in the spot right next to my B with the chrome wings
I was sent here to own things
Both sides of the court, colder than the airport
Therefore I'm the one them hoes here for, yeah, boy

They start runnin', turnin' chicken like a nugget meal

Spun the wheel, bought a vowel, I don't owe you nothin' still
Fuck a deal, I can do it with my own team
Won before Sheen, hear how all these hoes scream
When I was fourteen, sippin' on my OE
Tryna marry money, but that bitch kept gettin' cold feet
Music loud, hear it bangin' through the whole street
Beat gettin' shit on, ha, toilet bowl seat
No sleep, just work
Got a couple horny girls in a see-through shirt
So believe my hype, muthafuckas can't read nor write
Still they talkin' shit, man, I've seen your type
Got problems, can't sleep at night
'Cause your girl want to come around, freak all night
I'm a sex drill when I'm rollin' off them X pills
Five bikes, ten wheels, girl, I'll leave your legs still
Say, ""I don't do drugs, just weed,"" haha
Well, I'ma do drugs and speed down the street
Do doughnuts, your flow sucks, you so butt
Your girl's gettin' throat fucked, I get high, I go up
Why you sayin' that he's a trend?

So much coke sniffed, fuckin' hoes with bloody noses
Just a couple doses, fuck the roses

Have I answered the question, ""Who am I""? (Mhm)
Well, I confront it all the time
We're teaching people how to use their head
The, uh, point is, that in order to use your head, you have to go out of your mind
You have to go out of all of the, uh, static symbolic ways in which you think

[Verse 1]
If it was colors and shapes, the imaginary
'Stead of all of this weight that we have to carry
Would you be able to breathe?
And if you could just find where that comfort resides
No distraction or movement that fucks with your mind
Would you let them see?
While beneath the ocean, I met with the captain
Who sank to the floor on his ship
All of his passengers escaped to safety
But he was not done with his trip
He looked up and smiled, asked me, ""How do you do?''
I told him, ""I'm losin' my grip""
He told me, ''Son, if you want to hold onto yourself
Then let yourself slip''

[Chorus]
Fall, ooh-ooh-ooh
Fall, oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fall
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
 [Verse 2]
These puzzles are so hard to make into pictures
Of something that they'll understand
They could open their eyes, still be blind to the beauty
But march on the heart of this land, oh-oh
Why don't you turn around and go home?
They invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense
These things that a man doesn't need
Take out the love and the passion and hope
And they fill it with nothing but greed
While floating through galaxies, they said I couldn't
I noticed how sad one can get
'Cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful, I find
I can't understand nothin' no more

If I jump, let me fall (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh

Back when my back was on the wall

It don't feel like summer when you fall
It don't feel like nothin’, feel like nothin' but your fault
Lookin' out your window
Wishin' everything was simple
Wish you had the answers and the info
Wishin' that you kept it real
Wonderin' what the fuck you still pretend for (That's 10-4)
But when I'm on this tempo, feel electro-fyin’
Drinkin’ jet fuel, I ain't scared of flyin’
Skippin' rocks on clouds
Droppin' down, landin' on top of the house
Shit sound foul when it come out of my mouth
Yes, a Rolodex could be better
I guess I could be a little smarter
I could probably a little morе together, whatevеr
Rights and wrongs write songs from the center of a heart
I put into every measure from the start
When I entered I knew everything would finally fall apart
So I stayed sharp, waitin’ on a face card
Kings and queens, kings and queens
A whole world built around made up things
Don't say I didn't warn you either
Taste like candy, but it feel like ether
Young Caesar, true leader
Put the pour in two liters 'til I seizure
Fuck around and missed a feature
Not a person, I'm a creature
Motherfuckin' legend, please don't label me a sleeper, yeah
In your dreams, Freddy Krueger while you sleep
Fuck tomorrow, shit, I'm on to next week
I know this shit ain't sweet
I just want some motherfuckin' peace, please

Yeah, okay, it's big bank for me and the homies, yeah
I need money, don't need you to know me
Never seen a saint when evil approach me
I'm just tryna be safe
But how can I sleep when I know reality's fake?
I'm trapped in a dream state
Fuck fate, I believe in decisions that we make
Be great, everything that I give you a keepsake
And I don't need a grave, just let me be cremated
Scatter my ashes under the pavement
I put the team on my back, and I never break it
Carry it all, I'm feelin' weightless
Your life require maintenance, get acquainted
Temptation, desire will swallow you whole

Hours on the phone we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, goddamn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'

You was there when I was just a starvin' artist

Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin', you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said, ""All you ever think about is sex""
I'm like, ""Oh well, you know me so well
And if this what make you late, I swear I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail""
Well, I'm the jealous type, but I swear that ass is what Heaven's like
And when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
It's my only chance, I better get it right

Where you from? Who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in a spaceship
In a spaceship, shit is spacious

Swear your life is basic
All you do is sit around the house, you gettin' faded
That ain't entertainment, yeah
You missin' every single shot that you ain't takin'
Hey, kid, you could use a little bit of your imagination
It could do you right, improve a life you busy wastin'
Said it's your money if you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation
Okay, why you always hatin'?
Lacin' up my sneakers, I be runnin' out of patience, yeah
It ain't your money 'til you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation

Where you from? Who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in a spaceship
In a spaceship, shit is spacious
 [Verse 2]
Everybody famous, everybody wild, everybody dangerous
Get a couple dollars, now they act the strangest
Now they wanna give a couple statements
When you really 'bout it, you don't say shit
Pocket full of aces
Take over my city, yeah, that's really home invasions
All my homies wit' me, gettin' busy, no vacations
They ain't on my wave but they wavin'
Stop it, boy, you runnin' through your savings, yeah
I just feel amazin'
My head up in the clouds but my feet be on the pavement, yeah
It ain't your money 'til you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation

We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet, we don't speak the same language

Hey, hey, hey
New day, new city
Travel across the country, picked up like a kidney
Shit, we smokin' like a hippie
Feelin' trippy, gettin' jiggy, tryna boogie it down like it's the '60s
DJ, could you play my song?
What we would hear when we was kids, and always sang along
They sleepin' on me funny, PJ's is on
Now the beat drop kinda how you break your bong
Days is long, but the nights is longer
Funny how [?] might be proper
Lemonade and ice tea, made an Arnold Palmer
Sittin' by the pool with some bitches playin' doctor
Sippin' [?] skinny dippin', plenty women would be chillin'

Acid rains drops on a cocaine brain
Got a marijuana mind, talkin' dope boy slang
The boy doper than Kurt Cobain
People tryna act like they ain't heard my name before
I'm a badass kid to the core
Tryna walk into the mall with money, cleanin' out the store
Used to be a scrub and now I'm gettin' all this love
Probably because these motherfuckers see I got it buzzed
So if this my song, you better put it on
And I stay with thumbs up like The Fonz
Ayy, cooler than the sun shade
Feelin' like a lazy motherfucker on a Sunday
One day, my money gon' be tall like Dikembe Mutombo
[?] bow to your sensei
Never follow what both my parents say
'Cause life is dope and we get paid, hey

Just strollin' down the street, and I'm coolin'

An empty spot up on the shelf I need a vase to put, there
A couple wooden chairs, that be lookin' good, yeah
And, baby, if you want, I'll wait for you
We can sit inside my crib and watch a pay-per-view
'Cause I just need you next to me, keep you my accessory

Tonight a opportunity that you might miss
I just wanna get you feelin' right like this

Standin' at the top, how the fuck did I done get here?
Mouthful of yellow teeth, stomach full of fungus
Where the fuck is Mr. Tumnus? Somewhere hidin' in the closet
And what's a world to a compass?
It's nothin' but a day trip, a vacation
It ain't East Coast versus West Coast, it's real versus fake
And to murder the competition, do whatever it takes
He a Ricky Bobby brown-nose
Kissin' ass, tryna front like he thе headliner
Satan 'bout to get bеhind ya
If I must proceed to put him in his place
'Cause these petty little kids drink a half a pound of paint, and too sterile
Had syrup by the barrel, and now I got a kid I ain't allowed to see
I heard that Malcolm was a drug addict, now he free
Why he with a prostitute covered in cocaine on the balcony?

Uh
Well, it's the motherfuckin' M to the A-C, M to the I
Double-L, E-R, fallin' from the sky 'til I land
Crash into this planet, skippin' through the universe, I vanish
And disappear, wise beyond my years
Ridin' through the streets but too high to even steer, so I hover
Three hundred feet from the ground
And I don't plan on comin' down
You run around like a chicken with his head cut off
I'm havin' chickens, give me head, no special [?]
I'm on my pimp shit, swimmin' through [?]
Let a thick bitch give me brains, watch a chick-flick
Somethin' About Mary, nut in her hair
Her mom hear us, but I don't give a fuck if she there

So I focus on my money, get enough I can share
And get me drunk, I don't care, I pass the money to my team

Bitch, I got more talents than the homie Mr. Ripley
As a youngin, knew that hip-hop was in me
At fifteen, dropped a mixtape and it was iffy
Worked to get better, took my time when I was sixteen

Still a youngin, in discussion like a grown man

Bunch of fine hoes chillin', feelin' up the whole van
I don't fuck 'em just 'cause they supportin' me, hell

No groupie gettin' glory, ain't doin' nothin' for me
That's why I never let 'em stay the morning
I just open up my eyes when I wake, and I bake
On my grind, stayin' scruffy, never shavin' my face
A lotta time on my hands, never takin' a break
'Cause Sheffy hit me up with some paper to make

I've had all sorts of hoes (Sorts of hoes)
Take my time when I'm with her, drink my forty slow
Any given second, you can find us on the bed (Bed)
Wild sex, with her legs behind her head
Turn her over on her stomach, get it from the back (Back)
She always leave a scratch, but I like that
She the type that (Type that) you wanna wife that (Wife that)
And she like me 'cause all I do is pipe that (Aha)
Buzzin' like a bumblebee that's chillin' by the hive
Love her with no limits, 'cause my ceilin' is the sky (Ceilin' is the sky)
Feelin' up ya thighs, tongue ticklin' ya twine
When I get it from behind, you say it's twistin' up your spine (Aha)
Baby, I'm (I'm) one of a kind that finds that spot that have you climax
I'm that boy
 [Chorus]
It's all right, It's okay, seein' you all night and all day (Ayy)
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
It's all right, It's okay, seein' you all night and all day (Ayy)

I'm a motherfuckin' fool (Yeah), cut the check
I'm a workin' motherfucker, need a desk, shit
I don't got a heart, I don't even need a chest
I'm a mess, they be sayin' they up next, that's a stretch
Hold your breath, let me bow to the crowd, shit, I'm blessed
Well I must be, bitches want to fuck me, bump uglies on front street
The cards on the table, gin rummy
Have a blast, have a ball, have a motherfuckin' great time
Beast, I'm a dog, got a squad full of K-9s
I'm a motherfuckin' fool, cut the check
I'ma get it 'til there ain't shit left to get
No stress, runnin' suicides, don't even break a sweat
I'm a threat, code red when your line get pressed
You gettin' fucked by your contract, what the fine print says
Told you once; I told you twice; I get the lamb; it's over rice
I whip the Lamb, it's overpriced, the life is good—the hoes are dykes
This type of shit don't happen overnight (God damn)
I'm a motherfuckin' fool

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
This shit on one hundred degrees, hard as fuck, ain't in a rush
I let the money come to me, I'm a businessman
I'm way too young to be this rich
Don't know what to do with all this shit
I'm out of control, Lord, can you save my soul?
 [Chorus: Mac Miller]
How convenient, you ain't worried 'bout shit right now (Yeah)
How convenient (Oh yeah), you're just tryna keep it lit right now
How convenient (Goddamn), screamin' money over bitches right now
How convenient, bet you're feelin' like the shit right now (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
How convenient, undefeated
Walked up in Neimans, spent the sac then I'm leavin'
Smokin' on reefer, OG reekin'
If the cops pull me over they gon' want to take the Bimmer
But I'ma do the dash, beat it like Tina
And I got my nina, boy, you better be subpoenaed
Walked in the spot, ice on, lights on, blingin'
Someone start a fire 'cause it's fuckin' freezin'
I'm high off life, give me the blunt, I'ma roll it
I got hot rocks, I'ma let you hold it
I was posted with the hammer, y'all was tellin' police
Now I wrestle with the racks, bitch, I'm Mick Foley
Shit made me go, ""Woo,"" like Rick Florer
I mean Ric Flair, bitch boy, I've been player
You a bench warmer, boy, I've been playin'
Walked up the stairs, look at my shoes like, ""Them cleaner""
But I should've worn the other ones 'cause them better

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
This shit on one hundred degrees, hard as fuck, ain't in a rush
I let the money come to me, I'm a businessman
I'm way too young to be this rich
Don't know what to do with all this shit
I'm out of control, Lord, can you save my soul?

How convenient, you ain't worried 'bout shit right now (Yeah)

Yeah, extract mescaline from the cactus
Have a bad trip, while my conscience do a backflip
Used to look across the street at the projects
Kick it with Punch now, meetin' of the bosses
Got a pop star in Beverly Hills
Drive over in the Bimmer off the ecstasy pills
That's my goodie pussy thang-thang
Turn her on her stomach, sayin', ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"" yeah, yeah
And he's strange, sleep deprivation got me deranged
2010, gettin' money, screamin', ""Free Wayne""
He was gone 'til November
Got a couplе mill' and put it all in REMember

It's Adventure Time and I'm always Dave Crockett
There's a tail and they on my head, yeah
White trash, black tire
White rapper, black driver
Past bitch, I got pacifiers
Gold hat, with a glass visor
Originator, y'all pretender
Amnesia, still remember
Old Jewish, cold music, y'all sweet splendor
December, outside with the top down
Malibu, my block now (And my crib got a ocean view)
Tryna get off drugs, don't know what to do

https://genius.com/Mac-miller-day-one-a-song-about-nothing-lyrics,"[Intro]
I made this beat
Uh
Yeah
Oh, and I—and then I wrote to it too
So it go like this
It's like real late and Jerm's tryna get home
So I'ma try and one take a ma'fuckin' song
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse]
When you first start rappin', everybody curious
Then you make it happen, and everybody furious
Young kid courteous, don't know what the worry is
Wanna be buried in my Pittsburgh jersey, bitch
Nobody certain if you gonna make it
Life give you some hurt and then you gonna hate it
Sometimes it leave you cold and it leave you naked
But one thing for certain, I'ma leave it faded
Still young, but I wonder when my time gon' be up
When my time come, I'ma smile and peace up
Shorty sippin' forties, hangin' out by the tree stump
So Jerm and me started making hits, and it occurred to me
You didn't have to be like thirty-three to start earnin' cheese
With uncertainty, in it for eternity
A lot of style, little money, and some purple weed
Me and my queen, my girl, not Freddie Mercury
'Cause first you work for free, anything to get noticed
Stayin' focused, 'cause bullshittin' was hopeless
So treat yourself like a damn professional
Your first music check, damn incredible
Every day feel like the best day ever
Until every day feel like the best day ever
And you used to them days, kinda become a routine
You have a bad one, fuck up a good dream
You realize that you'll probably be away when
All the people die and you never get to say
Everything you always wanted to but never got the chance to
Start to weigh you down, what can a man do?
I could've stayed around, probably cancelled a couple of shows
Spent the last two years bein' dumb on the road, I guess
Haven't got to spend too much in the home
Time is what you make it, but player, don't be mistaken
All of your shit get taken
Broken, beaten and wasted, still I wouldn't trade it
Now it's 5 o'clock, but my mind won't stop
I've been thinkin' 'bout life, pourin' syrup in pop
Smokin' cigarettes like I'm really tryna die
Try to keep my head on my shoulders but my mind in the sky
I'm that moment when a gazelle and lion collide
I'm a burned down buildin' with a diamond inside
Yup, independent platinum, wishin' well passin'
Jewelry out the ice age, bitch outta Maxim
I be writin' this shit and just relaxin'
Let the time start passin'
 [Outro]
Yeah, so I just made this mo'fuckin' beat
And decided I was gonna rap on it too
It's late
Yup
Took my chains off to rap this song
Ooh, almost dropped my big chain, haha
Uh, who'd ever thought that I'd be standin' in a booth with a big chain?
Sike, I'm jokin', I don't got another verse

Something beautiful to brace my fall
Gotta find a melody
Gotta guide some memories
And don't believe in what they say

And can open up the blinds let the light in, please

World wants to swallow me right into the dirt
But fuck that, I'd rather a clique put three in my shirt
I'm headed to Heaven, crash landin' in Hell
My moms ain't understand that she's the man, I rebel
Got me trapped like a cell, so I put on some L
And lay back ASAP, I'ma yell my farewells
I excel from the other side of the world
Where the grass is greener and the shells carry pearls
And I'm here now, but one day I'll be gone
Until then I smoke a big L and put it on
'Cause I just live my life like that
Instead of fightin' back, I chill and write rap
'Cause I dream of the day where people pay to have my songs
You hate my style 'cause it's ancient like Babylon
And when rap is gone, I'll be too
You won't see me anymore, but I'll see you
And free you? Nah, I'll think I'll keep you a slave
'Cause your mind is in the dark like the back of the cave
And back in the day, well, I wasn't here

If hip-hop is dead, then I'm the resurrection

It's Easy Mac, I'll be mackin' it with ease
I'm the king of the land, the air and the seas
Please, who you know that does it like me?
And now my mind's fucked up, like I just took a Valium
I'm sorry daddy that I didn't bring back medallions
No grades to put up on the fridge
And I'm sorry that I didn't grow up as a kid
'Cause I grew up like a man, you need to understand
That I know that everything I got was put up in my hand
Yeah, it's my life, so you need to let me live it
""Kid's so privileged"", ""Kid is so gifted""

But I'm killin' wack rappers, cats that rap wacker

Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today
To remember the life of, of many, uh (Whoo Kid)

[Verse]
What makes this world so cold?
People have to die before they even get old
Stories untold, hog with a ho
Tell the homies and the hoes to leave me alone 'cause I know
That all I gotta do is stay focused, stay dedicated
I'm tryna get a bank with a better statement
And this is for the people who said I'd never make it
And for the hoes who won't fuck me unless I'm famous
Mind educated by the world around it
Been elevated in the Himalaya mountains
So now I'm drinkin' from the fountain of life
They wonder, ""Why this white boy stay soundin' so nice?""
Maybe 'cause I was meant to speak the truth to 'em
Over melody, I'm in the booth glued in
Pad and a pen and a glass of some gin
Me to music like this hat to a brim
Clean and simple, I can't be separated
You got a dream, but you scared and you yet to chase it
So you ain't goin' nowhere fast
Think you fresh 'cause your clothes got Polo tags
I'm on a journey, boy, I don't look back
Plus I'm fresher than a laundromat, now look at that
I can change the world on a Monday through a Friday
And turn around and get fly straight five days
Just gotta do this shit my way
You ain't a artist 'cause you got your own MySpace
Please don't waste my time
And if you got a lotta hobbies, don't say you grind
'Cause you way behind, I'm on my way to shine
In a hurry, ain't takin' my time
'Cause I've waited long enough, my time is now
All these bloggers online tryna define my style
Say, ""He a stoner, he don't know shit
Ain't a struggle in his life he gotta cope with""
I'm just tellin' you what's in my mind
'Cause I'm finna be the best when I'm in my prime
Now they got The High Life playin' in rewind
Say I'm somethin' of a different kind, haha, I guess
Homework must've slipped my mind
Where the fuck you find a youngin who can spit like I?
My button down shirt equipped with a tie
'Cause, boy, I'm on the business side, haha, yeah
Young entrepreneur, no Diddy though
Who makes movies while y'all makin' home videos
I just wanna let my whole city know
That the young boy finna blow, uh

A love song
In the key of Lex Luger
Deeper than pink

[Verse 1]
I didn't even mean to break your heart
So lemme put it back together
It's funny 'cause I kinda thought that this would last forever
I been goin' through the pain, miss when this was at it's pleasure
""I love you"" sounded better then, now it's just repetitive
Sippin' on codeine, girl, that's my sedative
'Cause I can't sleep alone
When you needed me at home, I wasn't there
Fightin', yellin', you tellin' me, ""Nothing's fair""
Girl, I got a heart of gold, and trust me, there's enough to share
Chillin' in your underwear, we gon' do some fuckin', yeah
And after that I'll tell you how I'm so in love with you
Lay on top your comforter, fuckin' 'til the sun come up
Bubble butt, smack you on the ass after I bust a nut
Don't call you, ""Honey,""  but you sweeter than the candy
After Halloween and Valentine's Day, both put together
You never gon' find one better
This love for you last forever
Incredible, take you to festivals
When you in bed, fixin' your hair
You know that I love it curly
I love it when you wake up in the mornin'
And if it's early, we may fuck a little
Take her ass to sleep
 [Refrain]
I like what I see, I hope she take a likin' to me (Hey)

[Chorus]
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
Wanna smack me in my face, be like, ""Take that,"" haha
But she been my girl since way back
And I don't think it's ever gon' change
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
She can roll up all my weed, tell me, ""Face that,"" haha
She been my girl since way back
But still, I don't ever wanna change that

[Verse 2]
My drink is deeper than pink and she hate that
She love to talk to stray cats
Find an address written on their name tag
She innocent but smart as well
Deadly as the harm she felt
She either tell you, ""All is well,"" or ""Rot in hell""
All depends on how you wanna treat her, so I try my best
But, bein' who I am will have her all upset
And I don't know what I should do
'Cause I been born to make these moves
I just hope that I can fix her with a call or text
All unless, it's complex and difficult
Tryna figure out if it isn't or it is my fault
She keeps to herself, locked somewhere deep down in the vault
Place I haven't been at all
Where the strong survive and the cripple fall
Here, let's talk out in the hall
I just wanna know what's on your mind
Not only 'cause I love you, but I'm interested to find
What's behind those two eyes
 [Refrain]
I like what I see, I hope you take a likin' to me (Hey)

[Chorus]
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
Wanna smack me in my face, be like, ""Take that,"" haha

Ah, Jerm
Ah, Jerm, you shouldn't have done 'em like this, man
Hey, uh

The definition of cool: that's me, yo
Ask your girl about me, bet she know
I'm the future, you a fake, Miss Cleo
All my bitches bad like Shaq shootin' free throws

Hey
Ayo, first name Mac, and my last name Miller
On beats, I'm a monster, iller than Godzilla
Yeah, my skin vanilla, I'm hotter than chinchillas
Hittin' Vegas for the night and cop a villa
Get my lyrics from L, and my soul from J Dilla
Chillin' with the sour 'cause some smoke'll kill ya
I'm just mean, tryna cover all these magazines
And bitches tryna give me treats like it's Halloween
Lil' old school flavor when it's Jerm on the drums
Dodge the bullet points like it's words from a gun
Spittin' flames so they burnin' my tongue
Bitches wanna fuck, but they heard that I'm young
And they still do, I'ma stick around, call me mildew
Go and stay in Bel-Air like Uncle Phil do
Get rich, go and buy me a mansion
And get my parents a nice crib up in the Hamptons

The definition of cool: that's me, yo
Ask your girl about me, bet she know

Jet Set general, roll like a innertube
Drinking on tiger's blood: that's what winners do
It seems as if you'd like to hang from my genitals
Whoa, pause, oh gosh
It is I, the D to the I, with the two G's
Like it's Gucci attire
Why? Don't ask why, you so inquisitive
And the shoes I'm wearing are only limited
My bad, was that a bit much? A tad
Didn't mean to rap, that was low class
Pardon my rudeness, that was so crass
And I'm always making moves 'cause I never procrastinate
The number one spot is up for grabs, too late
What was that question you asked?
What's the definition of C-O-O-L?
If you haven't gotten it by now, ah, oh well

Uh huh
Yeah
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Alright, well this is every drip out the pot
These are my thoughts in constellation form, connecting the dots
I'm switching plots, I am Sir Mix-A-Lot, she give me the box
Then open up like it is Christmas, even though it is not
I put the cinder to the block, and build the city on top
The sweat is dripping, it's hot
As if the stove was [?] left on in the kitchen
Or a key left in ignition, I'll be out here frying chicken
All these bitches think I'm kidding, I'm not
Turn on your television set to see my face on the screen
I often wonder how the fuck I'm still awake in my dream
Maybe I'm free, or maybe I'm just dangerously close to crazy
I'm losing all my brain by the piece, mhm
Well, I've seen the highs and lows
And I suppose when I was broke these bitches gave me no time, or access to their phone lines
But ever since I'm famous they freaks
This life is motherfucking crazy, you can take it from me, mhm

[Instrumental]
 [Verse 2]
Yeah, okay I'm back again like I never left
It's young rhino in a china store, I'm making a mess
I give you everything you need, and then I'm taking what's left
I'm one hundred percent sure not taking a guess
Okay I'm coming for your heart, you see me aim at your chest
Ancient fairs, say your prayers, and some way I'm possessed
Angel of death, but that’s only when I'm angry or stressed
Save your breath, I'm no D.J, I ain’t taking requests, mhm
Ain't got no time for that, L.A, California where you find me at
Reclining back, mix ingredients to make my mind relax
Time is fast, tryna fit the world inside a giant bag
Heaven knows never sell your soul and try and buy it back
Self control, I lost it on the yellow gold
Watching seconds go, waiting 'til my hell is froze
Ain't too late for a G
Life is motherfucking crazy, you can take it from me, mhm"

Uh, I got a pocket full of posies
Some devil with a pitchfork keep talkin' like he know me
I'm psychopathic, low-key, my hyperactive dome piece
Get no sleep, ill as fuck, the hospitals seem so weak
I stood before an Angel as he told me 'bout the glory
Put me in a room of people, how the fuck could I be lonely?
I only get money, these labels tryna clone me
Uh, my thoughts get heavy, hit the ground and crack the concrete
So, I try to keep 'em in my head
It's sad to see when everything that you believe is dead
Word to Heavy D, and rest in peace to all that come and pass
Life is good sometimes, but it just doesn't last
A bunch of stress, you see this mic is like my punchin' bag
Rock 'n' roll, drugs and cash, you softer than a bubble bath
Sucka ass ma'fucka, ma'fucka's sediment
Doper than the shit that killed Chris Tucker in Dead Presidents
Desert rhymes, homie, ridin' beats, I'm on a camel
I'm way too hot to handle, life a beach, I brought my sandals, heh
You want a war? I got a lot of ammo
You ain't a soldier 'cause you rockin' camo
Young Rambo, hundred million fans though
And I do it big, you a iPod Nano
Fire on wax, look like I brought candles
Yeah, you got a show, but you ain't on my channel

Hey
Ayo, I'm 'bout to start gamblin' with Ambien, I'm dutch smokin'
That's a strike but fuck bowlin', I could tear a pin of Maryland
See, I'm American, apparently it's damagin'
To be in front of cameras in your underwear with Marilyn
Monroe-lookin' dumb hoes who want too much dough
And come close to have you straight trippin' when you jump rope
Don't rock the love boat, this business fuckin' cutthroat
And it's gonna crack if you just paint the wall with one coat
Rooms filled with blunt smoke, peep me through the fog
These rappers who be hatin' probably need to get a job
See, me, I'm with my squad, gettin' money, livin' comfortable
I know a couple hoes who model, but they ugly though
Fuck a toast, y'all is fuckin' broke, cut ya throat
Judgin' me is nothin' dope, boy, you lyin' under oath
God made the world, why did man make the scriptures?
And if he created Lennon, why'd he go and make a Hitler?
I could take a photo, but I'd rather paint a picture
Of the one Laurence Fishburne, we'll shoot up all you hipsters
I'm from Pittsburgh, that's black and gold
If my skin gets filled up, I'ma tat my soul
Runnin' out of paper, writin' on my hand

It's the rap diablo, macho when I drop flows
The bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rappin' head honcho, rockin' shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow
Follow me, I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my G-pass? None of your fuckin' beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little eight ball, show me where the ki's at
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish 'em
Tryna find a balance, reachin' from my equilibrium
Fools, I pity 'em, I'm not a human, I'm amphibian
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men, I ain't savin' nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'til the angels come, and skippin' all the famous functions
How do the famous function? The A-list can't be trusted
I strong-arm 'em like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society
I tell my bitch if she don't love me, then just lie to me
I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich, this is piracy (Piracy)
Finally, I don't even need my fuckin' eyes to see
Come and die with me

I find Jehovah in the darkest places, empty as apartment basements
This a marathon, gentlemen, go 'head and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
You'll come up missin', tell your bitch that you been trippin', now you on vacation
Rappin' like it's automated, lights I keep 'em on like Vegas
Lava makin', so hot I'm turnin' hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star, I'm way farther with the constellations
Contemplatin' suicide like it's a DVD
Lost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch, I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke
Gordon Bombay in these streets, ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast, every word I spit rewritin' history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Run into the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle, I'm the show, you the commercial
I been poppin' like a kernel, readin' Justin Bieber's journal
Treat you like a urinal

She keep on gettin' played like it's recess, break her heart's a reflex
She wanna hit the beach and show her titties down in Key West
Someone leave her cryin' all the time and now she finally outta Kleenex
Sick of dudes not givin' her the respect
'Cause really she a genius, a CEO
Tryin' to be on top alone, she don't keep them close
She been waitin' for the opportunity to be a boss
Tough bitch, probably would've thought she played lacrosse
Sick of bein' soft with her heart broken all the time
Want some money too, fuckin' dudes
And fallin' all in love with who, was nothin' new
Only comin' through to bust a nut or two
She just need her family like the Huxtables
And now she on the road, left them home to takeover
Get rich and have her crib made over
But she gon' do it partyin', with her cup full
Ain't gon' trust you, but she gon' fuck you, haha

But she's scared to let you get too close

And then she's finally all alone

In high school, they were callin' her a slut
But now she comin' up, Louis Vuitton, and Juicy on her butt
See the bitches that be hatin' like, ""What’s up?""
'Cause they ain't doin' nothin', and she out here stuntin'
Middle finger to them hoes, all them bitches had it comin', haha
Yeah, on top of the world, she lookin' down
Invite you to the crib, let you look around
Just a fuckin' tease, tryna get your cheese
Invite you out to dinner, 'cause she wanna eat for free
She could pay it if she wanted to, she won't though
Go home, she got more dough, haha

Um, ah, I love this song, I think it's a sleeper on the album
Uh, it tells a story about a girl, who know
A girl who, who kinda knows what she wants in life
And, and doesn't really care what people think about her
Um, you know, just everyone has those girlfriends today
They go a little crazy, you know, maybe don't keep it classy all the time
But they just don't really care about all that
And can just go after what they want
So really, it's about a girl that people may look at her as weak
But in reality, she's stronger than anybody else"

I know you'll never be the shit if you ain't smellin' your own (Smellin' your own)
And even God gave the Devil a home
Now the evil live in all of us, wherever we go
I had plans to be a innovator
This flight simulator, flyin' through the Himalayas
Sips from a blissful nature
There's blood on the hands they've been grippin' paper
The man in the mirror always my biggest hater
Bullshit for later, Malcolm, need to focus
I know you got emotions that are kinda hard to cope with, but
You gotta stay strong and always act cordial
Shit, I do drugs 'cause they help me feel normal
I'm a man of good morals, got millions in the plural
Would go to outer space if you informed to where the portal is
Knew I was the one, but never got to hear from Morpheus
Life get interestin' when you realize how short it is

Yeah, six thousand dollar Versace shoes
I would burn 'em in a second, materials are nothin'
But I'm addicted to stuntin'
And I grew into a person I'm kinda wishin' I wasn't
I'm so happy when I'm drunk though
Feelin' so free when I'm high
Two packs a day, you could say I upgraded
But fuck bein' famous, I just wanna be alive
Sometimes I can't sleep, I can't live with myself
I don't even know what it is I don't like
The hot days and cold nights start to feel repetitive
The exorcist tried to take his own life
While trippin' on acid, I started to bug
'Cause the things I did to her make it harder to love
Before I sunk deep in this yellow submarine
Had to realize where I was

Fuck a movie, gonna make a scene (Let's go)
Sit back, let me hit the lights

Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with you
What you doin' runnin' [?] from a view of love and truth
This a business, no one gives a shit about you (No)
They gon' fuck you up, go and get this bread without you

Above all, fuck the law, bitch, I'm on now
Ride around puffin' loud with the top down
Start a goddamn riot in the compound
Turn-turn-turn the whole room into a dog pound

Just a soul that the industry after
They said I wouldn't make a lot of money no more
Fuck with my money and I'm comin' for war, be sure"

And the flow is jacked, Colt .45 in the grocery bag
You know it's that explosion rap, fire cracker, broken glass
These motherfuckers ain't bubblin', the soda flat
Forever I'ma go to bat, bitches wanna hold him back
Impulsive, irrational, he a maniac, but fuck gossip
Keep it casual, where the paper at?
A couple problems, fuck options, too late for that
I need the check, someone tell me where the waiter at
Oh, it's the devil, tell me where the angels at
And tell 'em I want my—, I want my—, want my baby back

Ladies tryna text me, sayin' that they home for the summer
And they heard that I'm livin' on my own
So they wanna come to the crib, maybe cook me some supper
But I'm busy, so I'm ignorin' her
Yeah, I just touched down in California
Now I'm headed to the beach
Go and swim in the water like I'm tryna sneak in across the border
I do all different types of crazy shit
I'm the youngin hoes tryna make a baby with
'Cause it'll make 'em rich
Know I'm headed to the money, so these funny little girls wanna take a trip
But no, only the M-O-S-T Dope with me
Other fools homo, Roy and Siegfried
No disrespect, though
I got addictive cigarette flow for the green pesto, presto

I'd like to make myself believe (Haha)
That planet Earth turns slowly (This is what I was talkin' about when I said K.I.D.S. was gonna be some life-changing shit, bitches)

'Cause everything is never as it seems (Big Jerm makin' me sound crispy and shit, hey)

Yeah, I'm highly underestimated
So educated and getting paid quick
If you ever hated, anticipate that I'm famous
Got a bunch of bitches to sip on the champagne with
Celebrate that we seein' another day
Life good, never wanna end this
Me and mary jane got a really nice friendship
Yeah, they give me money, but I gotta go and spend it
Man, I been a bad little Jew
But I gotta pay the bills now, so I gotta chill out
I ain't walkin' 'round like I'm splurging with a mil' now
Feel like the kid working at the mill now
Used to just chill and smoke joints up at Bill's house
Now I got a schedule, things I gotta do

Uh, I said raps is cold, about twenty below
I just realized I don't give a fuck any mo'
Used to look into the mirror askin', ""Where will this go?""
Got big quick, kinda wish that I was takin' it slow
It takes balls to go and break from the mould, I guess I did that
I still got some dumbass fans who want K.I.D.S. back
And I forget that they twelve years old, I must accept that
Should probably stop thinkin' so much and just rap
I wish life was kinda easier to figure out
I wish it was like Ferris Bueller singin' ""Twist and Shout""
I got a couple reasons that I'll stick around
But for the most part this shit is foul
I place my hand on a stovetop to see if I'm awake
I heard you takin' bath salts and eatin' people's face
Saw the people I know personally
I see they act a certain way because they workin' for me
And if you take that as a diss it means I'm talkin' to you
Know I never look down, I got knots in my shoe-strings
Made some money, went and bought me a few things
This ain't shit, I'm just doodling, haha
I'm sick of goin' to the movies and people lookin' at me
Inquire 'bout some shit that they know they shouldn't ask me
Hollywood got every girl around the world fasting
Like eatin' was a sin, when really beauty lie within
Guess I wouldn't fuck me a fat bitch
I just disagree wit'chu determining fat is
Wanna go to Israel and see if there's a God there
For now I'm 'bout to smoke some blunts and post in this lawn chair
Could've been the mayor 'cause I'm excellent with politicking
People never say what's on their minds because they on a mission
Who do you think you are?
And may God damn your soul if you forgot tradition
Locked inside a box, a prison, somewhere there I saw a vision
Met this girl with innocence and stole it while on top of linen
Rocket, word to Roger Clemens, that don't mean a thing
I'm in love with makin' melodies but scared to even sing
For you judgmental fuckheads, talkin' 'bout my life
You don't know me, and if you did, you'd say I'm nice
Everyone I see always has some cool advice
'Bout what they'd do if they were me and all the issues they would fight
You could never fathom what this shit is like
And I hope you turn your bitch to dyke

Catch a early flight, hit another city
For a concert full of fans who be fuckin' with me

Travel navigation, I switch up my location
Days goin' without shavin', the road life's a bitch

Got my money comin' faster than these women I get into
Can't tell me how to live my life, chill, fool, I been cool

Get front row, then show their boobs
Party every night, they worry that I'll blow the fuse

I swear to God these bitches love you when you up (Woo)
Don't got time unless you down, otherwise don't give a fuck (Nah)

Right butt-ass naked, rollin' up weed (Weed)
Goddamn, I'm the motherfuckin' man and that's a fact (That's a fact)
I'ma run this shit forever, took a oath, I made a pact (Woo)

Alright, let's get started
Woo (Yeah), you can feel it (Yuh)
Can you feel it? Vibrations (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Okay, I went to sleep faded, then I woke up invisible (Wow)
Keep the ingredients, but I got the kitchen full (Woah)
My thoughts is cynical, actions unpredictable
Supermodel bitches hold auditions in my swimmin' pool (Woo)
This feelin' is feelin' pretty invincible (I know)
Pray this life reciprocal, and I'ma come back an eagle
Thirsty for evil, the wine chilled in hell (Right here)
I gave my life to this shit, already killed myself (Woo)
(No, no, no, no, no) We ain't the same, homie (No)
The world afraid to change, but it changed on me (Woah)
Always been the realest, keep the same homies (Uh-huh)
So all that bullshit fades slowly

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
It's goin' (Goin'), goin' (Goin'), goin' (Goin'; Okay), goin' (Goin'; Ooh)
Goin' (Goin'), goin' (Goin'), goin' (Goin'), goin' (Goin')
Will you follow? (Ooh)

Okay, I went to sleep famous and I woke up invisible
Rich as fuck and miserable
At least I did Kimmel and Arsenio, my mom got it on video
That's the shit I live for, all this other shit is trivial (One, two, go)
Wi-wi-wi-will you bear witness to a miracle?
I don't know, I'm not a kid no more, comin' for those residuals (That money)
Be asleep in a couple minutes
My bitch have a nightmare, wake up, made me some cereal (Woo, woo, woo)
She knows I love my cereal (She know it)
The sun come up, look at her face, said, ""Oh my God, here we go""
(Don't blow it) Yeah
Am I okay? Fuck no
Just so nuts, so
Need to let the drugs go
Tryna find Heaven, I get high but never come close
We still wonder why we'll never learn to love
It's because all the air is filled with gun smoke
A middle finger to the cyber gods
Fall back or I'ma fuck around and let this virus off (Get it?)
In the mud, fuck your brainwash, I'm signin' off (Dead)
Can't kill a god with an upload

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Yeah, goin' (Goin'), goin' (Goin'), goin' (Goin'), goin' (Goin'; Ooh)

Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination? (Wow)
Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination? (Wow)

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
I used to dream about Vegas (Uh), pourin' cream for the ladies (Yeah)
Coke err'where just like it was the '80s, fast forward, crazy (Uh)
BBC jeans futuristic like Darth Vader babies (Uh)
Sharp like a lightsaber swung by Luke
And that Comme des Garçons make your girl wanna puke
'Cause she with you (Bruh), and not with the dude
Sticky situation 'cause her eyes are glued
She admire my fire and the way I pitch her deals
She hungry for my time (Huh, what?), Richard Mille (Yeah)
Easy, homeboy, fast moves will get you killed (Yeah)
Think that nigga there for nothin'? (Get for real, get for real)
Don't get it twisted 'cause I smell like Teen Spirit
You know what that cost, don't lean near it (Move, nigga)
You could have it all, nigga, just like Adele
But you gotta stop actin' like you snort what you sell (Ha)
Imagination can turn shit stains to big things
Even big planes, but first you gotta spit game
Stop talkin' 'bout your old dollars and make some new sense (Yes)
Quit bein' a nuisance, where's your blueprint? (Where ya blueprint, nigga?)

Uh Uh (Pink Slime)
It all started with a attic, a copy of Illmatic
He had it before the cash and the model bitches and actresses
Ass and tits, all this ass and tits
Got him trippin' like a set of Louis bags and shit
Happiness, he don't know the half of it (yeah)
Attic state of mind, he could use that view
Work addict, got the itch like a new tattoo
Turn this music into money, he could do that too
But everything can go away off a few bad moves
So if your first shit suck like a new vacuum
Now we rap game hustlin', bank account strugglin'
Tryna make that song that turn him into somethin'
His family life strange, they so weird about him buzzin'
Hallucinative fantasy, he chew that shroom
But he would kick it with his fam if he could do kung-fu
Always worry about his parents, asking who loves who
But all you really care about is that they do love you
And when your Auntie came home with a new Uncle
Who wasn't very polite, you didn't want to be nice (You would run into your room and dream away)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
(Huh) Dreams do the body good
Stop standin' around, y'all could do it too (You heard me), yes

That shit you just not doin'
You fools is like my sons
I love 'em like Hi-Top Airforce ones
I love 'em like my haters 'cause they push me to that paper
That million-dollar bed set
Billion dollar dreams, million-dollar baby bonnet
Ball for a winnin’ team
Number one draft pick
Gets a little drafty on this balcony
Slippin' 'til my smokin' jacket
Pullin' Christmas trees outta vacuum sealed package
Happy holidays, I'm high in a daze for all of my days
Finding my way through this maze we call the rap game
Bumpin' Frankie Beverly in my Chevy
Smokin' heavy for my homeboys who got killed before I got a chance to show 'em Beverly Hills
You right here, not forgot about
Eyes closed, but I still see, watchin' out
So high, I need a parachute
When I’m hoppin' out, when I'm drivin' out
Ya’ll sleepin' on me, I'm livin' my dreams out

This sound like brand new diamonds, gettin' on planes
You let these girls fool you, you Ichabod Crane
Listen ma, no, you ain't in Kansas, this ain't Wichita
Twist a lot, now you see, me now you don't, sick mirage
They told me, ""Get a job,"" now I got a big garage
Filled with cars, see? This what you get when you stay workin' hard
This don't come easily, Buddha on my chain
Tell ya, ""'Kuna to matata,"" no worries, simple and plain
When I pictured what it is, well, shit isn't the same
Got some women who complain, makin' me go insane
I'm livin' better than I ever imagined
But the way some people fake it's like competitive actin'
I used to never have a clue, but
Now me and money gettin' closer than a crew cut
New shoes don't make a man
But they always make him feel like a hunnid grand
Yeah, uh-huh

Young boys head stay spinnin' like a dreidel (Spinnin' like a dreidel)
And hoes let me stick it like a staple (Uh?)
Gettin' brains while I'm sittin' watchin' cable (Aha)
And that's just the life I live

I'm just a kid with a troublemakin' nature
Lookin' for a way I can double up my paper (Paper)
Ayy, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu haters (Nah)
The game's just hungry for some flavor (Take a bite)
And I'm flavorful, I don't spend a day in school
Treatin' every second of the day like it's April Fools (Aha)

And Mac's still talkin' here in the third-person
You heard certain, I'm word-servin' 'til the birds chirpin' (Birds chirpin')
I don't rest, I'm awake, call me Adderall (Adderall)
With the off the wall raps, call me racketball
Palm itch, poison ivy on my basketball (What?)

At the crib with some hoes, chillin', watchin' The Wire (Aha)

Hi, I'm sitting in the clouds
Everything around seems different to me now
And this could be a change for the both of us
Get away from the world that's controllin' us
It's only just me, I hope you trust me
You look a little nervous, keep adjusting
Your blouse that you got on
The buttons come undone
Let me know if you need me to put a fan on
I stand on the floor, 'bout to collapse
The bliss turns to war, heart turns to ash
Fun turns to drugs, the idea of cash
Has taken away my mind

Been in this room
Like I was hidin' from somethin'
Look, uh

Posin' a question: how many been empty and holdin' aggression?
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother, my mind is my weapon
I'm lettin' it go, loaded and pointed at negative energy
Tellin' me stop, they tellin' me, ""No"" (Don't)
Your aura is somethin' you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feelin' come after the shock
Praise me, I'd rather you not, 'cause
It's drivin' me crazy, the fact that you pay me amaze me
That's somethin' I love
You come to the club searchin' for drugs, drunk, fuckin' these sluts
God loves me, what if he does? What does it mean?
You wastin' away doin' nothin', you frontin'
Why aren't you chasin' your dreams? Ugh
We wonder 'bout life, but none of us willin' to learn
The money we earn is somethin' to burn
Why won't they give me a turn? I'll
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When them high-rollers homes in Vegas raided with some home invasion
Contaminatin' the place with plague, we just saved the day
I waste away in a room spittin' these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back, yep

Get out

Forfeitin' the war, he lays his sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store, begins to contemplate
Dealin' with death like he work in the morgue, absorbin' souls forgotten
He lost his way, starin' down that barrel, thinkin', ""Not today""
Life's so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death 'til there's nobody left
And you holdin' your breath 'cause you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinkin' of gettin' ballistic
Be specific, to those in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itchin', all I kill is time
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shootin' lasers

You on the map, but we the motherfuckin' capital (What?)
East End, I'm takin' it back, facts are actual (Uh-huh)
Mac, just let me get a track, gotta rap with you
Stackin' it fast, packin' the piff, puff and passin' through (Okay)
Fasten the passenger, trackin' the black Acura
Strap in the back, passin' the passion to rap, smashin' it
But we done seen things, whatever the team brings
Knots in our socks, duckin' cops on the Green Scene (Yup)
Play hard, thеy don't want it with me
It's Wild Bitch, motherfucker, stay runnin' thе street, yeah
Every day, it's like fuck this, sit back
Don't gotta work when I double the kick back

Yeah, motherfucker
Blowin' on that piff, y'all know how we do it (Oh yeah)

Let it bang, no fireman stoppin' my flame (Flame)
C might as well let me burn the city down (Down)
'Cause I'm hittin' all these trees and my feet haven't hit the ground (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
But when the kid's around (Uh-huh)
You know I'll split the ground-ground (Yup, yup) with a foot step
Never see me look left (Look left)
I'm a crook and I look fresh (Look fresh)
Yes, really, is this me and Billy the Kid?
We sittin' back, hittin', chillin', on the silliest piff
The empire of the East End (Uh-huh)
Fire up the weed, then (Uh-huh)
Cop a QP and stay blunted for the weekend (So blunted)
We friends, sittin' in the City of Steel
Me and Wild Bill for really for real in this (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Thought we told 'em, man
We just kick back, basically
Roll up that sticky-icky ganja
Hit that shit, get high and just bang out tracks like it's nothin'

Recordin' some buggy-ass tracks
While we up in Tuff Sound Recordin' makin' that heat

Smile with my chest out
Shit, I've been stressed out, they thinkin' I'm depressed now
I just wanna go and chill in Kanye West's guest house
Bitch pull her breasts out, I forget about my ex now
Feelin' fresh out, chillin' in a penthouse
Been here for so long 'bout to start payin' rent now
She used to cook me breakfast 'til I turned her to a pen pal

Maneuver away from evildoers
If Gene Hackman is captain, no one can beat the Hoosiers
See the future, no crystal ball that I'm starin' at
Ancient Egypt pharaoh rap starrin' Jack Kerouac
A half-a-ton of cattle dung, this shit I sadly have become
Ashin' blunts 'til I'm left with only half a lung (Half a lung)
Yeah, I'm here, self-proclaimed deity
Cryin' durin' the Lion King, that's just the G in me
Highly offensive, been on both sides of the fences
Hence the confusion when I stare at my reflection
Man's duality, life and its formalities
We're born as potential, then leave as a casualty
I'm in the lab, suited up, performing alchemy
Meditating 'til I'm levitating out my seat
It all started with a PayPal
 [Refrain]
Dripped up, draped out
It's all good, you safe now

In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya

Got some freaky hoes and weed to blow
Rock the cleanest clothes
My life different from every single kid you know
Places I go out on my own
Hoes stay blowing up my phone
But, I wanna be left alone
Doing shows, hitting four, five cities in a row
Hit me with some dough, 'cause they know I'm 'bout to blow
You can always say, ""No"", if you wanna lay low
Girl, you look so good you need to get up on the floor

I feel so fly and I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's the same old dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But, I'm just another face in the crowd
I said, ""I'm just another face in the crowd""

They tell me it's impossible to do it, I'd be stupid if I tried
But I'm using a maneuver, keep on moving 'em aside
I'm just trying to make some music for the ride
Listen to it when you drive, destination, you arrive
Russell Crow, just a beautiful mind
Got talent, imagine what I'll do with some time
I'm giving you a high feeling, moving your spine
Usually, find me chilling up in Jupiter
I'm so happy when you mad, Khakis, let 'em sag
Mom says, ""You could see my ass"" and she laughed
Blindfolded on the turnpike, hoping I don't crash
Stashing the weed under the passenger seat
Hope these sixteen wheelers don't crash into me
People taking pictures when I pass in the street
Zoom by, don't fasten my seatbelt
And now you know how we felt (Aha)

Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?
I feel so fly and I hope you can relate

And now I'm growin' up, lookin' around this planet
Some shit be goin' on and I just can't understand it

Moments all candid: Kodak
Reminisce and go back
Life real good, want y'all to know that
Don't have no deal and no half a mill

Go platinum independently, incredibly dope

And—and—and if you do what I do, then go and follow

Had to take the beat and let it breathe, usin' up the oxygen
The kid, he go and rock and there ain't nobody that stoppin' him
Poppin' up, bars on bars, you see me stockin' up
Workin' every second of the day is still not enough
Not on that cocky stuff, want y'all to acknowledge us
If you don't suck my dick, bitch, esophagus
You probably just go all on the internet
See a conversation, then you feel the need to interject
I ain't finished yet, you don't think this kid a threat?
I'm on the loose, ain't find me supervision yet
You a MP3, I'm still in cassette, vintage yet
Futuristic with some shit that split your deck
My cadence complex, rhyme without a concept
Atomic rhymes, you just a stupid fake bomb threat
6 in the mornin' and I'm writin' these rhymes
Workaholic, so you know that every night is a grind
 [Chorus]
Face the facts, you got to understand, ain't no stoppin' me
Face the facts, but all—all you gotta do is keep it real with a playa
Face the—the facts, you got to understand, ain't no stoppin' me

And if—and if—and if you do what I do, then go and follow"

To-told you that we won't stop, the drought is over

Ridin' with a L, I feel like John Travolta, yeah
Out the door, left my sorrows layin' on the sofa
I'ma run 'til I can't no more

Peace of mind, never was easy to find
I ask myself, ""Do I believе in my lies?"", no
Continue chasing pain
It'sway more than 50 shadеs of gray, I'm looking at them all
Sometimes I wonder if I waste away

Well, I never felt macho
When I was 6, I feened a high, started rollin' up cilantro
Listenin' to Joss Stone
My mom brought some groceries back from Costco
Got the shredded mozzarella and made some nachos
Oh, how the time pass
We went the highway, can't read this map anyways, and I can't find gas
So I'll buy a flask, and yell out, “Fuck!” (Fuck!)
These are the times that I loved, then lose
My life feel like a old bitch I cheated on
Now I gotta fill the pain 'cause the weed is gone, all the hard drugs are liquidated
I see my reflection lookin' at me, I begin to hate it
Lost my marbles, and I don't know where my eggs is (I don't know where my eggs are god damn it!)
I'm not transparent, you see the light, my opaqueness
I couldn't play the keys on a bitch, where the fuck Taylor Graves is?
Tweakin' out, Josh noticed 'cause it's more of the same shit, that insane shit
But beautiful creatures have the ugliest faces
Oh life and all it's wonderful mazes
I got a new idea
It's just one of my phases, I'll be done in a couple of days
But for right now that shit, that shit sound amazing
God spit the best game, I tell her stop playin' me
Got this shit locked up, feel life like federal agencies
I'm adding new letters to the ABC's, 'cause everything is make believe
Make sure you get a second to yourself
Find your own space to breathe, find a space to be
Because reality just sometimes, it ain't the place for me
But I must also open up my eyes for fake shit they make me see
Oh I can’t wait to be, free

Okay, um

Yeah
Oh my God
Well, been inside a studio for so god damn long
Starting to question that I no longer know what's goin' on
The room startin' to fill up with faces, and it's freakin' me out
'Cause we startin' to converse, and know what one another's names is
Thebe said I need a break, maybe he's right
Maybe I should chill, spend a day with my wife
I think I'm schizophrenic, and nobody's telling me because they don't exist
Shit I don't exist, just another lonely myth
Blowin' in the wind

Dealin' with everybody's opinion, tryna do me
Only down one, I'm in the final, shootin' threes like I don't give a fuck
Music, we fuck and switch the position up
We love the things that keep on bringin' out the kids in us
Been workin' all my life to do some different stuff
And people have the nerve to say I'm young and haven't lived enough
I'm on the road, my girl so sad I'm gone
It's hard when I can't even find the time to call my mom
And she thinks I'm goin' Hollywood, I guess she probably should
It seems like people see the bad and don't acknowledge good
I feel the shade, but I can see the sun, I'm cool
I've got the time, but feel the need to run, a fool
Is what I've become, young and I'm dumb
Been spendin' cake to get some bump in the trunk
Drums with a pump like some Reeboks, see me from the treetops
They worry, but they need not, heatin' like a teapot
Now I think I'm cool 'cause I got a pair of shoes
And mo' dough, a jacket with a Polo logo
My cup always filled with Henny, so no Fo' Loko
But they should know, so, ha
I could go slow, you see that I'm smooth now
Used to ignore me, they study what I do now
With some help from Kweli, and it's Like on the Beat
It's cool to say that my cypher complete
 [Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Word
I'm so sick with the verbs I use, the words that heal us
They love how we kill it on stage, man, Murder theaters
No wonder they call it a bunk, I sleep in a coffin
Dead tired, exhausted from how often I be tourin'
So gangsta, like the occupation of Made Men
Creatin' chaos, my operation is Mayhem
The movie never stopped, the frame change over
We added Mac to the wolfpack, Hangover
That Hen is not a friend, I'm on that Lagavulin
Whatever substance, I abuse it like a grown man
You not a kid no more, no one to hold your hand
And Four Loko make your shoulder lean like a Dro fan
Go ham, like Abraham readin' all the Psalms
Oh yeah, and don't forget to call your moms
Same thing I told Bow Wow last year
Take care of the fam, 'cause it's all we really have here"

Responsibility it would seem is now drownin' him
""You get another suicidal thought,"" I told him, ""Count to ten
Or go up to the roof and look down at all the happy people""
My shit is mad cerebral, paintings on a magic easel
Bunch of saints acquainted with Satan, now they actin' evil
A walkin' magnet, absorbin' your core's energy
Squeezin' beetle juices from Lennon to form remedies
A bit menacing, sadistic feelings festerin'
Beat you while you sleepin', let you dream with all that hemorrhagin'
A world of lemmings, zombies and happy endings
People that keep pretendin' they entertainin' a fantasy
In the shallow water you treadin'
Put your feet down, you might just meet ground (Meet ground)
It all started with a freestyle (That's where it started)
It's gon' end with a beatdown (Yeah)

You wish to enter into the forbidden cave where the monsters and goblins and fungus lives amongst the roses? There is no light here. There is nothing here for you. You would be better off if you just turned around and went back to your happy little life

Okay, live from a house that's made of porcelain
I ain't poppin' Mollys no more, I'm snortin' 'em
A bunch of powder I bought from Dr. Kevorkian
Do a line, stand up, start to play the accordion (Magic show)
I'm bored again, my mind is runnin' suicides and hamster wheels
Lose your mind when you decide to swallow all Amanda's pills (Current events)
I pour liquor inside my chamomile
Eat banana peels and post up in the south of France
Fuck, I think I conjured up the wrong shit (The wrong shit)
And now I'm being haunted (Fuck!)
Must be hallucinatin' all of this booty shakin'
(What an ass, what an ass, what an ass)
Ah! Haha, yeah
Defeatin' Dracula to go and post in Africa
Open up Pandora's box and fuck it (Fuck it)
We live amongst the rubbish, but all my bitches busted when compared to me
Apparently the fairest in the land, bitch, I'm ghost (Gorgeous)

If you could love, would you? (No, no)
Would you take the risk (No)
Of being vulnerable? (No, no, no, I would not)

There's not a price on understanding this life that I'm reprimanding
There's no planning in the way that I be tanning in the sun (And jammin')

High notes, Figaro
Drunk as hell off this liquor, but I'm in control
So, to my opponents: How you wanna do this?
Blood, sweat and tears in this music, I've been through this
No Jay-Z workin' on these blueprints
Tryna get my shit together, gettin' too rich
And these haters in my ear like a Q-tip

Can't start slippin' down these slopes 'cause it's all just (Downhill from there)
As a kid I didn't learn that, but (Now I'm aware)
When you a youngin', you just tryna live your life and have some fun
In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits, so I keep 'em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes, I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you 'bout to leave it to these young kids

Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of satisfaction
Fell asleep at Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on a idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, ""Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable""

The sun is slowly fallin', we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh, you left your phone behind?
Identity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us, and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless

That coast the line on the margins I rhyme, you chokin' or soakin' up game

Don't know where I am
Don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

That these things take forever, I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wonder if I could come home

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning?
I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said, ""This is the first day of my life
I didn't die before I met you
But now, I don't care, I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy""

I ain't got a day job, chillin' for the moment
Blowin' potent, my schedule's pretty open
Eat, chief, grind and sleep
And if I'm in the mood, go and find a freak
I am above and beyond, puffin' 'til the weed gone
Eons and eons, I'm tryna get my cheese long
Cup of tea and some china plates to eat on
Tempur-Pedic mattress that I count my sheep and sleep on
Flyer than a helicopter, homie, you a kamikaze
Feelin' good like I popped a molly
Drivin' slow, I ain't gettin' stopped by no cops
Speakers keep punchin' like a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot (Aha)
 [Chorus]
I'm flyin' away
Here I go, here I go
Got a little bit of drink in my cup
Little something to smoke, a little something to smoke
Call me later, call me later
I ain't comin' back around
Call me later, call me later
'Cause I don't think I'm comin' down

[Verse 2]
Ha, yeah, look
I smoke my weed from the Garden of Eden
Followin' a dream that ain't hard to believe in
My money European, got a market in Sweden
Hittin' on this L 'til it's harder to breath and to see
No iPhone, I got a 'droid, bitch
I'm makin' money now, you unemployed, bitch
Ha, twenty-four, livin' at your mom's crib
Get ya ass up, go and get a job, shit
I'm on the road, puttin' money in my pockets
Plus, the kid got the finest ho to go to prom wit'
To be honest, I'm the illest now
For real, I'm feelin' like killin' it up in Tinseltown
Ask the bitches I'm hittin', they know I get around
You? Another face in the crowd
I'm stayin' on your girl's mind
She screamin' out like it's her first time, ha
 [Outro: Marc Cohen & Stephen Baldwin]
Hey, man, we're out of papers
All right. Then get me a toilet paper roll, a corkscrew and some tin foil
We don't have a corkscrew
All right, then get me an avocado, an ice pick
And my snorkel. Trust me, bro
I've made bongs with less. Hurry up!"

Come to me
You a beauty with your Louis and Gucci
Baby girl, I ain't wanna be your man
But let me just write my number on your hand

You got your Forces laced up with some bunny ears
But now I got you all alone, and the booze gone

So let's roll, roll back to the crib
Grey Goose, lights dimmed, girl, that's how I live (You know me)
You got them kicks, fat ass, and some lips
Baby, you don't even gotta ask for a kiss
Shorty look proper, with kicks like Foot Locker
All done up, she a good shopper (Uh-huh)
New jeans, blue tee, and her shoes clean
Uh, lookin' like she 'bout to seduce me
Just touch me, tease me, cute caressin'
A hundred thousand pairs in your shoe collection

And anybody in my way gon' be left to die

Sick bars, I've been a boss, so stick around and watch it
Didn't fit around no college campus, chillin', writin' on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, It's just 'bout who the hardest
On my own too, fuck who's sayin' different
Every time I rhyme, I get that Punxsutawney feelin'
I'm the starter, you a fill-in
You a martyr, I'm just killin'
Gettin' harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in

Hold on and be strong, kneel before your king
The land you put your knees on, it won't be long 'til your path finds ya
And if love is just a fantasy
Then what's the problem if you fall in love with fantasy?

Oh my God, look at how upset you are
'Cause we out here winnin', brought my dogs from out the reservoir (Hoo!)
And I'ma let 'em bark, before you ready, my set will start
We forgot our roots before and trust me, things, they fell apart
Wash myself with acid, it's because I got a denim heart
My conscience so weak, I need to split it up in seven parts (Okay)
Revis brought me out to Cali for the first time
Went to Amar'e's party, took tequila shots with Kevin Hart (Ah)
But Kevin don't remember that
I saw him at the VMAs, told a joke, he never laughed (Um)
The rap diablo, ""free your mind"" my motto
And we all gon' be good if TreeJay ever hit the lotto (We mu'fuckin' rich!)
So arigato, shit, you know I'm world-famous
And R. Kelly been told me that I'm the world's greatest (You're the world’s greatest!)
But still to fall in love is like a orgasm
'Cause you never gonna know if your girl fake it
I'm always faded, gettin' shaded in the basement
I just bought a cello, now all I do is play it (Play it)
Thank God that I made it (Made it), ask Q where Dave is (Where is he?)
He'll probably tell you that he rollin' midnights out in Vegas (Seven midnights!)
Me? I'm in my spaceship, my face is so complacent
Wear a suit to cash a check, we goin' to the banquet (Ching)
And Jimmy got the burner (Bow) but he don't wanna murder (Nah)
And ClockWork is somewhere out in Sweden speaking Danish like
Hi Sven (Goddamn) isn't this your language?
That man must be a alien, I really can't explain it
Shit, it's just a little cocaine sniff *Snorts*
But the lines longer than parades is (Ah), yeah
I think it's time to give me all your praises (Praises)
So I can get this money and give all the homies raises (Raises)
My life is on these words, this is my affidavit (Wow)
And if you want a legal battle, send your ass to David (That's my lawyer)
Um, I'm half-man, half-amazin'
Probably half-God, but that don't fit my calculations (Don't make no sense)
I know the planet Earth is 'bout to explode
Kinda hope that no one save it, we only grow from anguish
 [Chorus: ScHoolboy Q & Mac Miller]
Yeah (Miller Mac) Miller Mac
Haha, yeah, these are my friends (Miller Mac)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
There's snowflakes fallin' on my debit card
Swear I'm not alive, I couldn't tell you if we ever are
In this game of thrones, it is known I got them 4G LTE connection bars
No control, fuck Ken' Lamar (Fuck you, Kendrick!)
I don't vote, I never registered (Nah)
But I'm a magnet for them zeros, call me Edward Sharpe (Woo!)
I wake up feelin' dead, I need a fresher start
So me and Q put people on the label we don't remember (Ah, okay)
Smiled as I saw Jerm nerdin' out with Josh Berg
Talkin' analog gear and drinkin' Arnold Palmer (Those are good)
In the other room, watchin' C-Span with E. Dan
Layin' down a baseline, doin' drums with his free hand (How the hell does he do that?!)
When I was in first grade, I wished to be Puerto Rican
My mom took me to a barbershop to get some cornrows
I walked in, ready for them Sprewell braids
But the lady said my hair was too short though (Aw), damn
I always thought my moms was the illest for that shit (Yah)
Drivin' through the hood, she did not have a reaction (Skrt)
With a six-year-old, she kept the doors unlocked
And drove by the 5-0 like ""Fuck those cops!""
Goddamn, it just don't stop (Nah)
I know my father probably wish that I would just smoke pot
My grandma probably slap me for the drugs I got (Boy!)
I'm a crackhead but I bought her diamonds, we love rocks
A'ight

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I've had the same outfit for six days straight (Gross)
And still all these bitches will get in position
'Cause I got their pussies all drippin' in paint (Woo)
Somehow, I'm makin' this music, it's just to relate to
(Damn, you're drownin'!) And I got the life raft, ain't gonna save you
Look at my reflection (Woah), I broke the mirror
It's only for protection (Okay), shit keep gettin' weirder (Weirder)
And I can't see a thing but (Woah) things never been clearer (Yeah)
Call the Mothman, it's Richard Gere (It's Richard motherfuckin' Gere!)
Yeah, this is our year
Let's get fucked up and get the fuck up outta here (Be gone)
I've kicked it with the aliens, a different stratosphere (E.T., phone home)
They lookin' down like, ""We come in peace"" (Oh, me too)
Yeah, I told Will and Bill they need to kick the habit (Put it down)
We on the same trip, we just got different baggage (That trip was brown)
Parks spilled the grape juice on all of Dylan's dad's shit (Grape juice!)
We were just some motherfuckin' kids (Woo)

Well, I saw this from a mile away
Now here we are, but that's okay
I didn't believe you when you told me
You wanna get know the old me
Do you? Do you? Do you? Yeah
Your eyes couldn't see me
I was always gettin' too high, too high
Too high for you to reach me
It's like my mind wanna leave me (Deuces)
But nothing's easy until it's gone

Why you always frustrated when I'm faded?
It's hard to have a conversation, what I'm sayin'
Feel like I speak a different language
And I'm way too tired to fake it anymore

Wait, it's too late
Wait, I can wait, yeah

It's 4 a.m., I'm drunk and stoned
So I text every option in my phone
I'm lookin' for a little bit of company, yeah
No one to fall in love with me
Just a good time, good time, good times
Lookin' for a little bit of trouble on the late night
I'm seein' double, never fumble when I play right
I'm stayin' safe, buckle up when I take flight
Girl, tryna find out what you taste like
I know I'm grown, but the feelin' too strong
Me and you could make time, love
We bygones, can't we get along?

I'm never gonna let you go—touch me—please don't go
Where are we? Do you miss me?
Please don't go—wake up—touch me
Where are we?

I have a vision to add: the gift of subtractin' limits
If everything was gone tomorrow, who would miss it?
And if I pack my bags and moved away, who would visit?
If you knew what you should say who would listen?
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout a new religion
Somethin' to feed off, we searchin' for it like groups of pigeons
Kinda futuristic, yeah, it's cool, we different
'Cause what I do's terrific, I'm just hopin' you can feel it
Yeah, so tell me if you can
Are you numb enough? Can you listen in?
I would lose it all to show 'em I'd get rich again
But matter fact, fuck that, 'cause I don't give a damn
You see it's simple when it's only cigarillos
In the world, no one should feel you, don't expect it from a little man
Fuck empty, my glass is filled
Countin' roses, daisies, and daffodils, chill

Layin' on my back, lookin' through the roof
Just tell me, am I gettin' through to you?
Stickin' to it, super glue it, make it beautiful
Fuck, what am I missin'?
Speak to your soul, so shut up and listen
Gimme a reason to pop, gettin' me goin', ain't lettin' me stop
Head to the top, it's better they not, call me a phony, so they sendin' me shots
I, got a girl, we in love, she my money, she my drugs
This my pain, this my pleasure, last forever, keep me up
Late at night, tell me it's alright, I believe her
I don't question she who knows me best, I know you wouldn't either
Somethin' happen when I see her, it's right out of a fairy tale
Got some shit she goin' through, it's something that she handle well
Life a bitch but she my bitch

I used to be a player who was searchin' for the one
Scared of bein' me 'cause it was hurtin' me to love
But then I found somethin' that I thought was real
You know, the type of girl you can cop a meal for
See, life is real good on the come up
I used to hit my lady with a text when the sun up, like, ""What up?""
And I gave it all away just to fall
Now I'm waitin' on the day when she call
Nah, fuck that, 'cause nowadays love is always lose
My heart's stayin' bruised if I'm givin' it to you
So I'ma keep playin' girls like they was a instrument
Try and find the one is just ridiculous, I'm sick of it
'Cause I found out that every girl the same
They sayin' that they victims but they love to play the game
So I ain't feel ashamed for who I am
And love don't really drive me to do these jams
But I tell y'all everything I write about
All the ups and downs, then the smiles, frowns
The good, bad, ugly, funny, and the money
The honeys, the grumpy, the hungry, whatever, haha
'Cause my life has never been better
She can't break what's underneath the polo or my sweater
And that's my heart, so fuck a heartbreak
This was just a little case of some heartache"

Music go with my funeral, ahem, yeah, I said

[Verse 1]
Said I was raised inside this gritty city, ridin' through, you probably miss me
My bicycle fell, I hit the road, the mailman almost hit me
All these sins were more than shitty, I just pray the Lord forgive me
Doin' drugs is just a war with boredom but they sure to get me
My side-bitch is sort of pretty, but she got enormous titties
Know I'm worth a fortune, she just want a brand new Porsche or Bentley
Had a few abortions, unfortunately, I forced them
Lord knows I'll turn a child to an orphan when I'm tourin'
I'm more than what I think of myself, I really have to be
Sit at home and drink by myself, my thoughts harassin' me
Actually, as a matter of fact, she ain't gettin' back to me
A shame that my tragedy my masterpiece, yeah
Trapped inside these dreams of mine
Just tryna get some peace of mind, yeah
I've been trapped inside these dreams of mine
So you'll never get a piece of mind

See, we swallowed in this web of lies, never try to exercise
You used to be a fantasy but now I guess it's televised
I heard the legends never die, oh, this lonely hell of mine
There never was a better time to better myself
Forever I melt and float away like waves in the ocean
Starin' inside of Heaven's eyes, the gates will never open
I'm smokin' on this field of hope, waitin' 'til my deal gets closed
I keep gettin' hotter but all I seem to feel is cold
Twenty-two don't feel so old, but I think I'm eighty-two
You mean to tell me God took seven days and all he made was you?
I'm out here with the kangaroos, makin' danger, break the rules
Celebrate my date of birth with acid, get the days confused
Happiness I take from you, searchin' for the naked truth
I'm not awake, I'm in a lake, I'll swim away with you
Bitch, check out the butterfly
If you the truth, then what the fuck am I?

Uh, eatin' shawarma, doin' drawings of Chewbacca
Bumpin' Flocka, fuck the drama
Marijuana been as calmin' as the fuckin' Dalai Lama
Your style common as a little league sponsor from retarded kid's fathers
I'm at meetings, shakin' hands and addin' commas to my net worth
Talk about my money please, and feelings might just get hurt
This the same effect and less words
Chillin' with this asshole, he call himself Sweatshirt
I think this might be some of my best work
I let these bitches dive in, but it's head first
Applyin' pressure when I put together letters
I'm a king, I'm a myth, beat a bitch down with my scepter
These Fendi treasures feelin' better than a million sweaters in Alaska
Your raps are corny as Nebraska
Lacksa-daisical bars, my throwaways will trash ya
High as NASA on acetone
Acid foam, talkin' trash like John McEnroe
You a little bitch, it's what the fuckin' cabbage patch is fo'
Watch me smack a ho
Turn around and catapult up above my castle's moat
Right into my fuckin' throne
Yo, this man is dapper, manufactured in hell
You candy rappers goddamn disasters, myself, I'm chillin'
Clubhouse, I'm demandin' passwords so villains can't infiltrate
This type of lifestyle that one simulates
My bitch is great, had a dinner date with William Gates
He took her to his big estate, the bitch flipped the safe
Slid, escaped through the kitchen, bang, dipped it down the interstate
Handed me the money, started suckin' me off
This a full-blown virus, we don't fuck with a cough
Made money off the white without touchin' the soft, I'm in there
Million dollars, I been there, 'bout a few times
Mulan, she on the futon, tryna do lines
This coupe, I'm in, highway about a buck fifty
Middle finger out the window, who wanna fuck with me?
I told Dom's and Hodgy, ""Stop poppin' molly""
Tryna blow up and die: some real kamikazes
Young fisherman sinkin' in Lake Michigan
Innocence, voice of an angel, some Minnie Riperton
Exquisite bitch, gettin' lit, live from the Wimbledon
Still sinnin', this ill pimpin' is Bill Clinton
She butt-naked swimmin', I'm payin' her no attention
Workaholic, got a TV show
I know you seen the crib, nasty since a youngin' mind
Sanitary birth, watch a beat get buried in a hurst
Yeah, I kill myself
Mac hippie analog, you rap midi, turn the camera's off
I made you snap and slap your bandana off
Your bitch greet me like I'm Santa Clause, mouth wide
I'm high as a satellite, see
I'm in ancient Greece, gettin' head from Aphrodite
Mac is mighty, got a bunch of whitey's actin' like me
I set the bar high
This a bizarre ride, word to Pharcyde
In plaid pants, hit a hole-in-one on the par-five
Eyes closed, drinkin' whiskey, let the car drive
These hoes thirsty, see the dick and they large-eyed
The rawest rapper, baby forehead autographer
On top of Saturn, I'm sendin' shots from a rocket blaster
Believe me, this is where geniuses live
It's Most Dope, be holier than all of Jesus's kids
But we speakin' to heathens and all of these Even Stevens who don't need a reason
Just want a bitch they can feed with semen
No need for sleepin', cheeba gon' keep me dreamin', I'm faded
Been in Cali a little too long, it got me jaded
Hit Japan and I'm Instagramin' camera shy samurais
Fuckin' up a Jerm beat, teach you how to vandalize
The bandana Santana tied
My sound amplified
Screams on Kennywood's Steel Phantom rides
My pockets fat, still lookin' for some pants my size
They over-analyze everything I fantasize
We could have a conversation, we could pantomime
Or you could come a little closer, put your hand in mine
This life a prison, time to set you free
Watchin' movies in silence, describin' what I see

Yeah, somebody died today, I
I saw his picture in the funny papers
Didn't think anybody died on a Friday
Some angry banker, some kind of money trader
Recently divorced, was drunk drivin' down the highway
And drove off the bridge to his wedding song
Blew out the bass in his speakers, you can still hear the treble goin' (Treble goin')
The hospital was useless, and everything was quiet but the music
Recently, I only meet peace when in deep sleep
Been the same dream, world safe, smile on her face
Waitin' on the other side (The other side)
I wonder if He'll take me to the other side (The other side), yeah
What your eyes see, too naive for war, and that'll screw ya
Still bet it all on the glory, hallelujah

All he said was he's in no rush

Eleven pounds, named after his uncle Gabriel
His mother cried with her lips against his soft face (Soft face)
Why'd she bring these bright eyes into this dark place?
Oh, sweet, sweet oblivion
Way before the information gets settled in
I swear to God I never wanna sin again
But I fear that trouble's on its way (Yeah)
The mind go with age, don't surrender
My mistake, I misplaced all of my remembers
Baby, there's a little vacation in the dresser
Take one for depression, and two for your temper

Bad hygiene, all about that gross life
Hate to see somebody fuckin' up their own life (Their own life)

I met her last summer at a concert
She's a little younger so quickly I knew I loved her
But, drunkenly I fumbled over wrong words
I just kept on speakin' as quietly she whispered to me
Love is the reason that the homies beefin'
Defeat the lonely demons
It's hard to go to sleep when all you see is
Her face and all the time that I wasted
So when my mind I'll be faded, whether we die or we make it
Where do we go from here?
I fear that I will be alone somewhere
And she'll forget me like a old hobby
So deep inside you, I would like you for your soul
Can I cop that?

Yes, lawd
Someone hit me the other day for a rendezvous
""Long time no see"" was the time she used
Bright eyes like the lights at the carnival
Held convos, but never held accountable
How's your Mama Duke? How ya papa doin'?
Oh, me? I been freer than the sample food
But like a sample loop, around and 'round I move
Until it's clear, then I'm back to baggin' bags of loot
Spent years tryna steer both hands on you
'Til I finally understood that I was spinnin' my hoop
Rather spinnin' my wheels, gettin' up in my years
But still I feel like a kid when I'm fuckin' with you
Young nigga gotta live, that's the motto they use
But all them niggas still live in they mama's backroom
So I'm back in my stu', lookin' up at the stars
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
That's when I caught light of myself (My god)
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myself
That's when I caught light of myself
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myself
That's when I caught light of myself"

Welcome to the, yeah
Welcome to the, yeah
Welcome to the, yeah
Yeah, um, yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the free mind
I pick you up from times that got you feelin' on a decline
Now we the giants, fee-fi
Just had to get some me time
Bitch, I ain't no average Joe, I'm motherfuckin' G.I
The weak spine can go to hell
I'm overwhelmed, can't even pick the car I wanna drive
Often times, we fear the disappointment from our father's eyes
Far cry to heaven, longer ride back home
Unconnect, a mind felon, never talk on phones
And fuck regret, we the legends when we hot or cold
I'm old-fashioned, very closed, and polka dot my soul, yeah
I made adjustments, I'm just gettin' started
Why the fuck I feel like brushin', like a sweep, or a snare roll?
How do I bear the weight to those I can't know?
Give light like a lamp post, and fix me up a ham roast
Everybody clap your hands for
The Wizard and the Tin Man, and the Lion and the Scarecrow
 [Chorus]
There he goes again, standing on his toes again
You are not alone, my friend
If this feels like home, why don't you come on in? ([?])
Have that glass of wine, share some laughs to pass the time
There's snakes in the grass, there's snakes in the grass

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I hate the power she got over me
I'm Bukowski writin' poetry
Hold on to imaginary rosaries
Put away your own beliefs
Guess we ain't the same
But we all came from Mother Earth's ovaries
Rabid dog, show my teeth, eat a motherfucker whole
Chewin' on your crunchy bones, spit out your disgusting soul
Homie, we don't love them hoes
Yes, we do, but fuck 'em though
Tell the doctor that my medicine can probably up the dose
I'm not there, but fuckin' close
Oh my god, I'm fuckin' close
Bitch, you ain't no fuckin' judge
But this my blood, I'm under oath
Shit, I guess it's just the way it goes
Yeah, better go and smell the roses if you wanna tell the world about 'em
I'm in my imagination, there's a world around 'em
And when they hate, eliminate 'em like you never knew 'em
Save me from my execution
 [Chorus]
There he goes again, standing on his toes again
You are not alone, my friend
If this feels like home, why don't you come on in? ([?])
Have that glass of wine, share some laughs to pass the time
There's snakes in the grass, there's snakes in the grass"

Uh, ign'ant-ass white kid (White kid)
But I'm still bicycling and recycling ('Cyling)
And I'm still eatin' gummy bear vitamins
All my bitches takin' Vicodin, huffin' nitrogen (Go)
Hyper than Williams', middle son
Since I was a little one, moms had to put me on the Ritalin
Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt
Told Chuck I had a couple raps, so we kicked the drums
All the best rappers are usually dead
But I'm the poison that left a widow Juliet
In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads
Comin' up with all the coldest shit, take your Sudafed
Contagious, speakin' while sedated
God shit, make 'em want to add a couple pages to the Bible
I ain't got nothin' left in my will
'Cept, ""Throw it all in the casket, it's mine still""
Uh, I need some backpack cast raps
Took a break just to kill the game half-assed
Set some rat traps, went and took a cat nap
Woke up, threw the dead bodies in the trash bags
Act polite, but I'm nasty on the mic
Your bitch don't want my dick, then she has to be a dyke
Slap her but she like it, tell me, ""Master, feed me pipe""
I'm the scotch on the rocks, you the Appletini type

And now, I'm out in Cali like Tone-Lōc (Tone-Lōc)
Young boy, but I'm chillin' with some grown folk (Grown folk)
No joke, Most Dope, you just bowl smoke
How much coke you gotta sell to make a boat float?
Hit 'em, hit 'em 'til they tell me, ""No more"" (No more)
I'm a highly difficult ropes course
Pullin' up to Rome on a chrome gold horse
Say ""Wassup?"" to the Pope, pull off in a Porsche
Who you kiddin'? Your flow's warshed

Turned my daughter to a queen, turned a dollar to a dream
Flashy as high-beams, smokin' on good weed

I'm rich, car service, no car keys (Yeah!)
First-class flight, 'bout to land to a new bitch (Yeah, yeah)
She fuck me and swallowed every homie I came with (Aww, aww)
MCM bag and, nigga, bet some weed in it
Two-hundred dollars worth of Backwoods, we all livin' (Yeah, yeah)
Brought the gangsters back the bucket hat, how real is that? (Ou)
I'm gettin' money, rub my tummy, that's my baller sack (Ugh)
Quarter million in a safe in case I get a case
Faggot-ass judge hatin' on me 'cause my money straight (Yeah)

When you grindin' all the time, there's a lot of shit to do
That's why I got Q, 'cause he keep me on the routine
I be too skeed, trying to kick it like Bruce Lee
Clean shoes, boy, new feet
And I'm never in the car with only two seats
I got a whip full of people, all fresh, call 'em 10 Deep
Motherfucker, we the future like next week
Young people don't see you as an equal
They just see you as deceitful, tryna send you back to preschool
You only gettin' one shot, no redo
Tell them haters keep they mouth shut, eat glue
Bitch, who the fuck you think you playing with?
I'm Justin Bieber meets Jadakiss
Here to take what's theirs, treat 'em all like Taylor Swift
Leave 'em in a daze, all like, ""What day is it?""

Fresher than your man, girl, but whiter than a plate of grits

I got a brand new phone, rocking brand new clothes
Leaving every single party with a brand new ho
Yeah, I've done a little travelin', circlin' the globe
Always keep it movin', inertia on these hoes
Boy, I'm an asshole, girls call him a douchebag
This some old-school shit, but no boom bap
This ain't new swag, it's the same old me
The youngin get respect from the game's OGs
Cameras flashin' when we passin', so we stay low-key
Go to Mexico to party where the pesos be
On the turnpike, bitch, and your tank on E
With my head out the window screaming, ""Get like me""
Ho, you should know the way I roll
Take a couple shots all to Superman these hoes
You ain't nothin' with your wack rap
Used to be the class clown, but now I get the last laugh

Walk down the stairs, kiss my momma on the cheek
Before I walk up out the door, let my feet create a beat
On the street that I'm steppin' on, matter fact glidin'
Climbin' out the atmosphere to travel back from Zion
People look at me a different way
Now they listen when I got a little shit to say
Shit has changed since the old days when I was a youngin
Shit, I'm still a youngin' but I'm spittin' like it's nothin'
Would've thought I had a hundred years under my belt
And if you hatin', you just fuckin' yourself (Haha)
I'm the kid they call the life of the party
Glass of ice and Bacardi get me right, so I'm probably
Swervin', I see you spittin' game and it's hurtin'
The precision of a surgeon when the hoes come in, searchin'
I'm just goin' with the flow like it's current
Watchin' my back for all you snakes and you serpents
Lurkin', jealous don't work and you selfish
Laughin' in your face and lightin' up the purple relish
Label me a man who make weed jams
Mad 'cause I'm writin' while I'm liftin' up a mountain with my free hand

[Verse 1]
It's 'bout time I break it down for these ignorant fools
Who still stick under impressions that we live by the rules
We just kids, with nobody to answer to
We just live, you need to understand my view
See, I don't give a fuck about your problems 'cause everybody got 'em
But ain't nobody want 'em, motherfucker, that's life
We try and do it right
Stayin' up, runnin' in the streets through the night
Maybe grab a couple girls, take 'em back to where we livin'
Or just kick it on thе porch with the homies, bullshittin'
No matter what wе do, we try and have a laugh
Rollin' up the weed you saved allowance just to grab
Before I'm out gettin' trashed, take a shower or a bath
Meet my peoples at the party in an hour and a half
Just another night gettin' right
So I might hit somebody's girl for some afternoon delight
But if it's in the night time, sippin' some white wine
I'ma phone a friend or use another lifeline
Just a smooth-ass kid, so slick and so cool
Fuck around and get obnoxious, I'ma piss in your pool, ooh
Stick and move, I be spittin' 'til my lips is blue
Smokin' weed in almost every single interview
Blow is what I'm finna do, sorry, I ain't into you
'Cause I'm too busy spittin' like a missin' tooth
Yeah, we shake 'em up, blaze and awaken
Breakfast in the mornin', glass of OJ and bacon
Strictly organic, my view is panoramic on this phantom planet
They be hatin', I don't understand it
 [Chorus]
This some shit to just vibe to, get high to
Never thought the boy would still be in this high school, hey
Summertime never seemed so close
So raise your glasses, here's a toast
This is to the young, to the old
To the hot, to the mild, to the cold (Hey, hey)
It's been a while since you heard this kinda soul (What?)
Thought you should know, give it a go

[Verse 2]
What I kick incredible, my piff is all medical
Try and write it down, but I'm gone, it's illegible
And these other rappers so typical
Chicken sandwich and some waffle fries, unforgivable
Analog motherfuckers, meet digital
Pitiful, hurt my ears every time I listen to you
People give it a boo
Have you mad as fuck, like you got some shit on your shoes
And you, you just some dog crap, never gonna blow
Mr. Malone, I'm deliverin' this flow
And it's hittin' with soul, so they givin' it a go
Hittin' all this smoke while the pigs is on patrol
Bitch, this Most Dope, don't you forget it, uh
On the mound, you can call me Andy Pettitte
On the ground and I lift off at the speed of sound
And it almost knocked my kicks off
Y'all angry in your bars, why you pissed off?
Be happy, motherfucker, this is hip-hop
So we get lost, get a gun, get faded
Sayin', ""This my song,"" every single time you play it
 [Chorus]
This some shit to just vibe to, get high to
Never thought the boy would still be in this high school, hey
Summertime never seemed so close

And a little hard liquor had me passin' out

I used to short a motherfucker on a half an ounce, uh

Cashin' out to get up out my daddy's house
But ask around, every time I'm back in town
My city hold me down like the motherfuckin' mayor, uh

So now it's time to trash the house
They on my trail like a basset hound

Came back just to claim my spot
You motherfuckers at the top really ain't that hot
Go ahead, homie, take your shot, uh, you only get one shot
I bought a crib that I can't afford
Have a butt-naked bitch come and sand my floor
Go hard 'til I can't no more
All of y'all better plan for war

Try and take what's mine? Just don't bother

Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband
And the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other
And find out about each other
We got to know each other little by little
Living very close in the same building, and he would help me with things
And I would see him and think, ""What a cute guy"" (Yeah, yeah)
And he was a cute guy
And it was just little by little, we got to know just to say hello
One day, I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him
People respected him, and he was good to everybody he knew
People he worked with all adored him, and it was something so important
The respect that you have for somebody, for me, was the most important
Being attracted to him and being, finding people respected him and I respected him
I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were
And I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time
So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together
And our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other
And the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other
After a short period of time, we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding
With just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life
And then came two adorable little boys
And my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys
And I feel I just gave him a wonderful life, a good marriage and a wonderful family
And I know he really had a beautiful life, and I did too
And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other"

Have you ever felt like no one understand what you loved?
Demandin' a hug, can't reach you when you standin' above
I got dreams which I need to accomplish, I promise
I'm honest, clean my conscience, see the nonsense
Good days are gone, they used to be here
Life is but a dream, doesn't seem to be clear
Been meanin' to write my thoughts down, jot down my mind
Take the words I can't say and put 'em into rhymes
So I'm up all night on this beat-up mic
Convincin' myself that I can't cheat on life
(I let a good girl go)
So, papa, don't preach, and mama don't worry
Nothing's gonna hurt me, growin' up in a hurry
(I let a good girl go)
I'm still learnin', waitin' for your teachin'
In this game of life that I seem to be beatin'
What the right thing to do isn't always understood
And some evil in the world is hidin' under good
Life ain't easy, don't put it past the name
Runnin' into coins, start with sacks of change
Tryna save up money for the microphone
And while everybody's out, I just write at home
'Cause to achieve, you need to leave things behind
Wear the rhyme book out 'til you can see the spine
(I let a good girl go)
Read between the lines, more than appears to be
Wonder who I'm here to be, so I clearly speak
(I let a good girl go)
Sit back with my feet up on the chair
I relax 'cause when the world's gone, rap will be there
Don't have to be scared, just sit back and chill
I attack these wack cats with the rappin' ill
Pass the Phil' 'cause I'm tryna get faded
It's sacred passin' round the blunt, it's the greatest
I wasted payments just to get the tree
Now I'ma stop talkin', so y'all can check the beat

When I party in New York, take the late night subway
Goin' out Friday to comin' home Monday
From all directions never find me on the one way flavor
The rhyme just the icin' on the cupcake fuck face
My fans notice these other rappers is bogus
I'm supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
And the boy stay, kickin' incredibly dope shit
Make my mama proud 'cause my clothes fit
Travel round the globe bitch, on my Lewis Clark shit
Don't matter where I live, 'cause I can tell you where my heart is
I just stay on my side, fuck where everybody at
Tell the planet, ""Peace"", 'cause I'm gone I ain't comin' back
Had the whole regular life I can tell you that I'm done with that
Try to build a mil' off a couple stacks
Own my own business, investin' all I got into these fuckin' raps

Takin' sips from the fountain of youth
If you ain't heard about the kid then you out of the loop
As I'm sittin' back starin' at this world in my eyes
See out the window in my room that I’m hidden inside
I'm just a kid who stays speakin' his thoughts, talkin' his mind
Life a roller coaster but I stay along for the ride
Put my heart up on the page, and the song gonna cry
There’s logic behind the way stayin' caught in a lie, boy
Ain't a shock that I'm a topic of discussion
Muhfuckers want my spot so they probably wish I wasn't
They give a little love like everyone does
In reality, they stoned off that competitive drug
And I don't blame 'em, 'cause those who above me, I'm gunnin' for
Try and make my way to the top, startin' from the floor
And I don't even need to bring a single gun to war
'Cause I be on some shit that they ain't never done before
Takin' over piece by piece, startin' from the core
It's only been a year, I can stick around a hundred more

Said I could stick around a hundred more
I ain't goin' nowhere
Young and so much time to go
Jerm, you might as well keep this one rollin'
I got like one more verse I haven't spit three verses on a song in a minute
See if I can remember this one
Aight look
 [Verse 3]
You can find me in the lab workin' overtime
Smell the weed when you going by, global grind
And I ain't just a local guy
When you feelin' stressed out, have an L
Blow money, keep my lady decked out in Chanel
Live fast when I die better wish me well
Huh, I just hope they servin' beer in hell
Just an everyday story that I'm here to tell
So please, stick around for the epilogue
For anyone who ever blog, probably heard my name
Hip-Hop's underdog, you wanna win the game
I'm sick of hearin' how music change never be the same
And these dudes who think they everything and never pick a lane
Call yourself a vet, but haven't won a single game
Mad, every girl got my name imprinted in her brain
Boy, I'm a beast, match the style in bars
Find me smokin' weed where the wild things are

I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feelin'
When you're high, but you're underneath the ceilin'
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealin', yeah
Get everything I need, then I'm gone, but it ain't stealin'
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always tryin' to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm sayin' it about

[Chorus]
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?
 [Verse 2]
When it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm runnin' out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of bein' so tired
Why I gotta build somethin' beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it, yeah
It's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's the problem with a closed door

[Chorus]
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad
Well, it ain't that bad, mm

Please don't tell me that you don't like me anymore, anymore
The time I've waited for you, all alone for you
I won't hurt you

Take me to that special place where you left me, where you left me alone
Alone, alone

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, we're inside confusion, it's what the brain do
Trapped inside delusion, I should thank you
Ask you how you doin', you said faithful
And nothing can change her mind
Girl beyond a human, and it's painful
I just think its soothin' to be next to an angel
Back before the ruins, look how Cain did Able
Who do you trust when you live in a lie?

No one but yourself, I tell you
Don't you know you blessed the devil?
Take me to another level
Trade that hash for dozens of petals
You tryin' to go places
You want to go places

She hate me in the mornin', love me by the evenin'
Eyes full of tears, you're callin' out treason
Tell me that I ain't shit, I just think I'm decent
Baby, be patient, I'ma keep you waitin'
I could use a prayer, say it in my downtime
No one's gonna care, if you're makin' love outside
Stop, wait a minute
Stop, wait a minute
She like The Rolling Stones, I'm a fan of The Beatles
She always wanna paint, so I copped that bitch an easel
Every single woman, they don't want to be equal
Hate me in her mind, all relationships cerebral
You know who I am, I'm a man of the people
Every single angel, wants a chance to be evil
And they take it, wait a minute
She gon' take it, wait a minute

No one but yourself (Yeah), I tell you
Don't you know you blessed the devil?
Take me to another level (Woo)
Trade that hash for dozens of petals (Okay)
You tryin' to go places (But aren't we all?)
You want to go places (Yeah, but aren't we all tryin' to—)

Yeah, we goin' places, lies of open cases
I know I don't explain it, but I speak a coded language
Other words, I don't say shit, but at least to you
I just pay your bills, and nothin' but your vehicle
But I could take you places, and I could show you things
You gon' meet the president, and you gon' know the king
Told Jerry he should hold the ring
Yeah, it's fictional, fantasy
My bitch always panicking, always try planning things
She roll her eyes when I'm rambling
Mind scrambling, divine channeling
A bunch of problems I'm handling

You want to go places
But don't we all? But don't we all?

You see that girl walk by, man?
Oof, she's somethin' else
I gotta say somethin', you know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
Uh, glance at her when she walkin' by
The type that never stop to talk to guys
She alone and you not surprised
'Cause she ain't fit for no other man
So you approach as a gentleman
""Hello, ma'am, today you lookin' pretty damn elegant""
I think she get the message like a telegram
I'ma be your cab or your yellow van
Tell me where, I'll take you where you wanna go
To the top, she perfect and she oughta know
When she walkin' by the studio
You can see my heart beatin' through my clothes
She ain't around, time movin' slow
I wanna be wherever you gon' go
And I wonder if she know my name
She shine like she ain't know what rain is
The game is the same as it was as some lame kids
You wanna hang with her every single day, it's funny
'Cause your friends say you whipped
Every late night, you gotta go and dip
To pick her up, and I've been sick of sluts
And this girl? She ain't gon' give it up
She want me puttin' in work like school
And I be smitten when she here, like a fool
But keep my cool, gotta be smooth
Eyes like Elmer, got me glued
These other dudes is not for you
I think Cupid must've shot you, too
 [Chorus]
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move
So I wrote a couple bars for you
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move
So I had to write a couple bars for you

[Verse 2]
I seen her at the dry cleaner, locked eyes
It was rainin', she lookin' like sunshine
I told her we could have a fun time
Let me just take you out to lunch
I'm a really nice guy, I ain't gon' hurt you
I ain't even 'bout to flirt, too
'Cause I'ma be straight up with you
And don't bring no makeup with you
I just wanna chill, kick it at the crib
Every time we kiss, it tickle on my lips
I love the way that you lookin' at me
I just wanna see you lookin' happy
You grab me, pull me, tease me, fool me
Ain't gon' let me get it at the movies
Why you sittin' over a few seats?
Come and move closer to me
Uh, I hope you know that you got me
Here's my number, girl, you can call me
And if you guessin', don't stress
'Cause I ain't havin' no mess
 [Bridge]
She the only thing on my mind
I think about her all the time
And it's hard 'cause I'm on my grind
But I think I'ma call her mine

Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move

And if by chance this is my grand finale
Then bury me in Allegheny County, it's the
The most hated, so faded that I'm bow-legged
Don't bathe, gross gang, smell like old Lo Mein, shit
The flow dangerous, make you wanna do the wave
Throw your bitch right off your lap and start a standing ovation
The most strangest, master of the ceremonies
A fifth of Stoli then it’s only Cher and Moby karaoke
My bitch a shooter, call her Annie Oakley
Get you for a pair of Kobe's, just got out on probation
And no famous friends for me, just old faces
I only go places wasted like I'm Joe Namath
Not a king, I'm no David, music, I'm a crackhead
No hobbies and recreation, don't even know my address
Self-medicate, self-education
Rick Rubin showed me transcendental meditation

The world will be just fine without me

It was a silent night 'til the fireworks

Yeah, okay, I (Okay, I)
I fear nothin' on this odyssey of dark roads
God lives in my dog's soul, the devil in his dog bowl
We are the prophets, Jesus was a poor sport, he booted Nostradamus
Turned water into wine, but he loved the gin and tonic, had skeletons in his closet
Even God will one day be forgotten
And recently I been feelin', I been feelin' like
It'd be really nice to get to sit with Mickey Weiss
Shoot the shit 'bout life, he'd be pissed I'm sniffin' white
Never got to see me grow up, how long it take to live a life?
I'm a bit surprised that I'm even still alive
Mixin' uppers and downers practically suicide
My old Jewish mind, REMember Music, you'll be fine
And I make my own beats now, if you behind
Hallucination's how I use my mind
Who am I?

I keep it honest as honesty gets
Don't know why I'm always talkin' if I'm not makin' sense
I've spent my life livin' with a lot of regrets
You throw me off my high horse, I'd probably fall to my death
(Bad behavior) It's obvious you're not on your best
I might just pull your card if it's on top of the deck
Give me, give me what I need and then I'm onto the next
That's what we callin' cause and effect
 [Chorus]
Yeah, why don't you wake up from your bad dreams?
When's the last time you took a little time for yourself?
There's no reason to be so down
Rather fly around like there's no ground
And I, I bet you wish you had these
'Cause carrying this weight'll break your glass knees
Yeah, don't need no chauffeur, fuck the backseat
No, I stay behind the wheel and never half-speed

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And nothin' change up
Forever came up, we made it
Let a motherfucker go say shit
One for the ages, this is one for the ages
It's outrageous, spectacular how I use a vernacular
To rap a word, slap you backwards, shit has to hurt
Hit a home run and come back to first, yeah
Backstage, no passes work
With a light-skin bitch, get her ass to twerk, yeah
This the work of a master person
But it sound like Catholic church, God damn
Who the man with the hot hand?
They go nuts when I drop jams

There's a birthday party happenin' upstairs (Where?)
And it's all for me, who the fuck cares? (Fuck it)
They won't notice if I never go and show my face (Face)
They just lookin' for a reason they can celebrate (That's okay)
I hate to waste the vanilla cake that they made for me (Tasty)
I tell the same stories, they pretend they never heard 'em (Boring)
I'll just stay down here inside the studio (Uh-huh)
Doin' blow and paraphrasin' The Crucible (Witch)
If you fuckin' with the God, that's a funeral (Kill 'em)
Lose your soul, I'm witcha longer than your student loans (Woah)
Who got the ecstasy pills? I need a few to roll (Raw)
I'm a real drug addict, homie, you should know
Somebody please tell Jimmy to put the pistol down (Stop, man! Please, please, please, please!)
He's serious this time, he's gonna kill me now (Bapapapapam! Ah!)
He'll regret it when I hit the ground (What did I do?)

Do you tell her that you love her but she doesn't care? (Care)
Does she tell you that you hurt her and you're unaware? (No)
Did you hear about a heaven, now you runnin' there? (Go)
Do you think about the fantasy and make-believe? (Okay)
Do you cover up your eyes, you can't wait to see? (Look)
Lately, I've been havin' strange dreams (Uh-huh)
Paranoid they hate me, everybody think I'm crazy
Baby, can you take me somewhere where the sky blue? (Uh-huh)
You can lead the way, I promise I'll be right behind you (Let's go, let's go, let's go)

Yo, check it, yo
Uh, yo
Aight, look (It's that good shit)
Let me just rap somethin', tell you how we do this on the East Coast
'Cause I ain't fuckin' with the other shit
Look, look

[Verse 1]
On the east side, we ride on the weed high
Jackin' cats packin' fat stacks in their Levi's
Rap for scraps at crack shacks that we be by
Fee-fi, hear me comin' down where ya reside, creepin'
Runnin' through your house while you're sleepin'
No reason, hoes at Four Seasons
I'ma keep rhymin' 'til I die and stop breathin'
I'ma keep grindin' 'til my mind hits the ceilin'
How ya not feelin', we stay dangerous
Major is to plagiarists gettin' paid for shit
This ain't a game to us, so don't play with us
Watch us combust while we kick it spontaneous
Judges favor us, they know we came to bust
Takin' candies from babies just like a stranger does
Parades in their names, ain't gon' rain for us
We real and rap while you lames stay changin' up
Guns aimed at us, we keep on keepin' on
Flee when the heat is on, fiend when the weed is gone
Dream 'bout bein' gone, the easel that we bleed upon see the wrong
Ya hungry? We need to feed ya songs
Mac is nice with the appetite, I'm the cook
Ya shook, one too many pages taken from the book
Look, the crook, I stay with the steel
And if I'm bein' ill, it's just the way that I feel
I say what is real
So you better hear it, fool
I'm a lyrical miracle, rap imperial (Yeah)
Turn shit around like a steerin' wheel
I knocked you other rappers out, now I'm here to kill
Everything you hear is real, haters fuckin' fear the deal
 [Chorus]
(Have you prepared for your last meal?)
I don't think you have, I don't think you have, I don't think you have
(Have you prepared for your last meal?)
I don't think you have, I don't think you have, I don't think you have, homie
What? (Prepared for your last meal?)
Yeah (Prepared for your last meal?)
Easy Mac, homie (Prepared for your last meal?)
Straight killin' cats, yo (Prepared for your last meal?)
Haha, lyrically (Have you prepared for your last meal?)
Aight, look, look

[Verse 2]
Around here, all we know is squeeze, clutch
Please teachers and preachers, I need Jesus
I ain't a Christian, religion is a prison of superstition
So listen when I'm spittin' sharp like circumcision (Ha)
Yeah, hear me on the mic, be like, ""He's rough""
Get off my dick, you can suck on deez nuts
Ya need us, like mothers need to cook
Ya skeed and shook from the weed I took, so read a book
Maybe that will help you to relax, ya passive, I'm massive
Like NASA and that bastard
But the only thing fat about me is my cash
I smash tracks on you, ass, so you should probably...
 [Outro]
Prepare for your last meal, prepare for your last meal
Easy Mac is killin' cats, so you should
Prepare for your last meal

This ain't just a couple screws loose, it's straight-jacket crazy
I don't give a fuck if I don't find my head
Fuck it, I gave every single fuck I had left
Yeah, why'd you get so high so early
So high, so early

Smokin' dope, it's hard to breathe
Feelin' stuck, it's hard to leave
Roll up, smoke 'em back-to-back
If you got some, we can match
Money comin', we can stack
Dime bags, twenty bags, fifties, hundreds, grab a seven
Got some extra, that's a blessin'
Roll me up, just roll me up
DJ Pour had me sippin' that sizzurp
TDot poured me up, faded off the wake up
I got makeup on my clothes
This bitch was sleep, this loud just woke her up
I don't think I smoke enough (Nah)
Cheech & Chong my motivators
Roll a facial, think of times I hoped for cable, we was broke
If I ain't have nothin', I had hella smoke (Hella smoke)
Leather coat, the fragrant's kush
Passed out faded before they played the hook
Got a foreign model tryna order out, she hate to cook (Ha)
I get high with Esco now, they shootin' shit, I made you look
My life is a movie, dropped out of school 'cause I hated books
I'm livin' like Rick James, still backwoods, ain't shit changed (Nah)
Mac know I'm far from sober, just started, it's far from over (Peace)

Yeah, walk in the crib, my dick smell of sex
Pussy, whiskey on my breath
My bitch buggin' when I come in, ""When you gon' clean up this mess?""
See, I'm American made, there goes my brain or what's left
When I get carried away, I know how crazy I get
Cash or check, bread and butter, take a number, place a bet
To the realest motherfuckers, ain't too many of us left
You can't tell me nothin', no discussion, flow is so disgustin'
Throwin' up a whole bunch of blood on a empty stomach
Got headaches and migraines, headaches and migraines
Every single mornin', like my brain flippin' sideways
Try to move my body but my skeleton vibrates
Whose car is that and how'd it get in my driveway?
This is high stakes, professional time waste
High as Macaulay Culkin, but lower than five basements
It's competitive life ruinin' horrible influences
I stay with headaches and migraines

The rich and famous, so nice to make your acquaintance
The legends put out their latest, I feel that it sound outdated (Sound outdated)
I'm the hardest workin' person in the universe

I'm just a human; let me make mistakes (Make mistakes)
Shit has changed, ain't little Malcolm with the baby face (Baby face)
Even my homies tell me, ""Take a break""
They know it ain't their place, and this a day I hate to waste

Perfect of synonym, picturin' her image inside my thoughts
Wanna kick it with you, this the only life that we got
I hit your spot, lick your body then wax it Mr. Miyagi
Need a taste of you every single mornin', girl you my coffee
And I drink you up, stay in bed all day no point in gettin' up
Swear I can't get enough(No)
Girl you so different, brilliant, you one in a billion
Make everythin' simple in this crazy world innocent
There somethin' bout you so dangerous
You try to make it through this tainted blood
Feel like it's made for us
Do you fantasize a feelin' so strong
That when it slip into your finger tips, you try to hold on
For your life, I've been wrong I've been right
But when I saw you tonight, you made me reconsider all that I know to be true
I need you back, I get that pussy wetter than a stream or river
A little weed and liquor, expensive cuisine for dinner
I can change your life drastically and hold you down like gravity
But if you need me I'm

Oh, how I've grown up so well
This is a toast, here it goes
First, I'ma need to sober myself
I'm coast to coast with the glow, 360 degrees
I've been around the world and still ain't picked up shit that I need
I do not think the same way, my mind is spiralin'
Dialed in, thinkin' violent, just never got time for shit
I'm highly functionin', 24/7 punchin' in
Ridin' 'til the wheels fall off, this life I live so tirin'
Up, up and away, but every day it's a new plane I'm flyin' in
Don't speak, I don't need that, please, I'm tuned out, why you still chimin' in?

Okay, well, I am not to blame, I will not be tamed
Out my brain, driftin' like I'm drivin' in the rain, that's a hydroplane
At times I got carried away, feel like I'm lift-and-shout
'Til I get back to the crib, have her legs both open up wide, I'm pickin' locks
This is not no Christian rock, but I can't stop prayin' for y'all
Sit on top those lists you got, when you're goin' through all them names to call
We out here playin' ball, makin' papers, save it all
I still wear this wealth way past my twenties, I won't take that off
Y'all motherfuckers really think I'm out here soft
Because I used to play lacrosse? You could still get tossed

Casualty, time flies casually
Live in blasphemy, music make you move your body, human trafficking

Not aware, unprepared, I was the white boy's parody

With the raps, but this the wrath of the titans
So let me enlighten you, the world goes around
Like a three year old's tricycle, fall, you better get back up
Don't talk to me, I said, ""Back up""
Why you soft in your raps, but in your head so tough?
Um, I can't wait to show the homies this one
We can ride around like '08 and blow out the system
Go out from quarterback, ended up the waterboy
Quit the team and started selling weed to the altar boys

Everybody get in line, see what's safe in my jeans
I’m on a nonstop grind like I'm chasin' my cheese
'Cause I got places to be and faces to see
If your boy got a order, need to place it to me
You wanna fight me? You can bite me, punks
Rob you for your ice cream and your Nike Dunks
I ain't chillin' in the club, but I might be crunk
'Cause I be sippin' malt liquor ’til my sight be fucked (Sight be fucked)
Lost day, cross-fade into reality
Feel the sauce, hate a boss breathin’ new formality
Haters, y'all save it all and paid ’em all salary
Your fate is just to fade and fall once you hear the sound of me
I'm grimy with the flow, you can try me
My eyelids is low, stayin' high from the ivory
Killin' tracks with Lil’ Mac beside me
N. Rossi on the beat, east side 'til we die, B

Yo, we be laxed with the hoes on our laps, sippin' Cognac
When we on, this is how we—this is how we—
Matter fact, we some macs where we at with my pack

Yo, dude wanna know how we do it (How we do it)
We be flowin', keep our rhymes movin' fluid (Movin' fluid)
And I really can't explain it, it's the way the Lord made it
If you haters wanna hate it, you'll get ruined (You'll get ruined)

And listen clearly, I'll pronunciate
Beat the pussy up, so the cunts'll hate
Gots too orderly, don't order me, the nuns are fake
I kill authority, no matter how many guns it take
I'm havin' fun with Jake, I run this state
I can't leave now, bitch, I got more blunts to bake
I gotta wake and bake, ain't gon' take a break
Heavy stacks of cash, call that shit a paperweight
Beedie, Nick, and Easy Mac, you know where to find us

I flow mindless, guy you can't rhyme with
I rip it first, then I leave your ass rhyme-less

Posin' a question: how many been empty and holdin' aggression?
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother, my mind is my weapon, I'm lettin' it go
Loaded and pointed at negative energy
Tellin' me stop, they tellin' me, ""No, don't""
Your aura is somethin' you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feelin' come after the shock
Praise me, I'd rather you not, 'cause
It's drivin' me crazy, the fact that you pay me amaze me
That's somethin' I love
You come to the club searchin' for drugs, drunk, fuckin' these sluts
God loves me, what if he does? What does it mean?
You wastin' away, doin' nothin', you frontin'
Why aren't you chasin' your dreams? Uh
We wonder 'bout life, but none of us willin' to learn
The money we earn is somethin' to burn
Why won't they give me a turn?
I'll feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When them high-rollers homes in Vegas raided with some home invasion
Contaminatin' the place with plague, we just saved the day

Forfeitin' the war, he lays his sword down and walks away
Grabs a forty from the corner store, begins to contemplate
Dealin' with death like he work in the morgue
Absorbin' souls forgotten, he lost his way
Starin' down that barrel, thinkin', ""Not today""
Life's so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death 'til there's nobody left
And you holdin' your breath 'cause you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinkin' of gettin' ballistic
Be specific, to those in control, we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itchin', all I kill is time— *Bang*
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shootin' lasers
'Cept I'm cool with Vader and blowin' up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor the youth can relate to, it's nature
You a hater? I'll deal with you later, no, thank ya
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really Doe, come on, homie, we major
I waste away in this room spittin' out raps

Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother, my mind is my weapon, I'm lettin' it go
Loaded and pointed at negative energy tellin' me stop, they tellin' me, ""No""
Your aura is something you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock, praise me, I'd rather you not, 'cause
It's drivin' me crazy, the fact that you pay amaze me, that's somethin' I love
You come to the club searchin' for drugs, drunk, fuckin' these sluts
God loves me, what if he does? What does it mean?
You wastin' away doin' nothin', you frontin', why aren't you chasin' ya dreams, uh?
We wonder 'bout life but none of us willing to learn
The money we earn something to burn, why won't they give me a turn? L
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When them high rollers homes in Vegas raided with some home invasion
Contaminatin' the place with plague, we just saved the day
 [Refrain: Mac Miller]
I waste away in a room spittin' out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back, [?]

It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Forfeitin' the war, he lays his sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store, begins to contemplate
Dealin' with death like he work in the morgue, absorbing souls forgotten
He lost his way, starin' down that barrel, thinkin', ""Not today""
Life's so precious, said, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death 'til there's nobody left and you holdin' your breath 'cause you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinkin' of getting ballistic
Be specific, to those in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, intertwined
My trigger finger itchin', all I kill is time, bang
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shootin' lasers
'Cept I'm cool with Vader and blowin' up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor the youth can relate to, it's nature
If you a hater I'll deal with you later, no, thank ya
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really doe, come on, homie, we major
 [Refrain: Mac Miller]
I waste away in this room spittin' out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back

It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle

You know what? Bein' old seem so butt that I don't think I need that
I'ma be a kid like Will Ferrell in Step Brothers, but with a crib
My brother gettin' older, out of college is the shit
But for right now, I'ma just visit, haha
 [Interlude]
That's how the fuck it go down, man
If you in high school
Or you remember when you was in high school, man
You gotta fuck with this one

[Chorus]
That party last night, I don't remember, I'm so hungover
We stayed up drinkin', twist an ounce as the girls come over
Drink my OE, smoke my bud, sluts know I'm just tryin' to fuck
So let's get drunk until we gone
Everybody chug your beer when the hook come on

[Post-Chorus]
I love high school (Ayy)
Ditchin' class (Ayy)
Gettin' fucked up, nuttin' in the bitch with the thickest ass

Alright then, bitch
Ha, ya
Uh
A million ma'fuckin' fans on that ass, biotch (La-la, la-la)
Feels amazin'
Ladies and gentlemen, I've always been the same kid (La-la, la-la, [?])
Now I'm famous (And I ain't even have to change shit)

[Verse 1]
Hey
Ayo, they keep on sayin' this dude back, this dude back
But I don't sound like this dude, bitch, I'm Mac (Woo)
Now these girls all tryna suck my dick, I rap, haha
I may let her if I'm sippin' that yak, yeah
Too fly, submarine in the sky
Can't go out in public, I better get a disguise
It's better to be yourself, don't ever just live a lie
While I'm drivin' with the top down, listenin' to Plies (Hi)
Chicken wings and fries, I'm in love with all the simple things
Little things, hoes just be around, always bickering
I got some money, threw some diamonds on a pinky ring
That's why your favorite girl probably on my ding-a-ling (Haha)
Chief blunts with Peanut, standin' on a tree stump
Rappers need to keep up, my bitch is double D cup
She fucks, but she ain't no slut, and she know that (Know that)
She freeze up, livin' in the moment, get her Kodak (Kodak)
Hold that, wait for it to flash, get the picture
I ain't doin' much, just out on this adventure (Ya)
Bus around the country, but I'm travelin' the world
With all these rappers that be hatin' like I'm battlin' with girls
 [Chorus]
Ayo, this where the hook be
But I ain't got no hook, you pussy
I said this where the hook be
But, bitch, I ain't got a fuckin' hook, you pussy
Yeah, bitch, that could be a hook
You know what, I'ma just rap, if it's okay with y'all
And you can tell me if it was nice
Aight, here we go

[Verse 2]
Uh
Ayo, I kinda want a fur coat, kinda want a grill
She met me at the party, now she kinda wanna chill
I ain't on no pills, just a little weed, molly, and lean
Yeah, I did a couple drugs, now they callin' me Sheen
This was all a dream just a week ago, now I got a heap of dough
I keep a ho that always has some weed to roll
All these rappers brag, but I don't ever see 'em flow (No)
The illest ma'fucka in it, we don't need to vote (No)
'Cause I don't give a fuck what y'all think
And I don't give a fuck what that dude on that blog think (Suck a dick)
Yeah, I seen hay, been to court in three states
Had to deal with cheapskates who always want a free play
You hold the weight of the world, I bet your knees break
Put my dick in a bitch hand, keepsake (Haha)
You can't keep that, fuck off my case
You can keep some residue if I bust on your face, heh
I'm just playin', mistake him as Asian
Always been amazin', since days I've been hangin'
In ancient places, now the kid famous
And he ain't even had to change shit, biatch

A million mothafuckin' fans
Just want to take a second to thank y'all, you feel me?
Thanks for fuckin' with the kid from day one
You know what I'm sayin', Blue Slide Park, November 8th

I wish I felt more certain today, yeah
I wish I was a little bit more assertive, but hey
I'm still learnin', makin' it out here, earnin'
Workin' way too hard to throw it away
And when it's been an off day, we part ways
I go somewhere I can get lost in, I do not change

I'm headed somewhere, a better somewhere
When I get there, I'll know

Hash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie actin' boujee

Truly, bitches must have them bad jeans and back is Coogi
Had to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming
Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact, but you, in fact, assuming
Back to doing (Cash pursuing), posted up like (Patrick Ewing)
Rapper feuds are sad if you would battle for a stack or two
These eloquent irrelevant sentences show my penmanship
Indefinite boundaries show you the end of it

Allowin' birds to fall to their death before they even fly (Brr)
He and I are not the same (Not the same)
Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me somethin' for the pain (For the pain)

Okay, I watch her sip the cyanide
Just like it's fine wine

Smokin' doobies, watchin' Sci-Fi movies
Make her fruit smoothies, wanna swim out to the buoys, but she terrified
Drownin' in the paradigm, singin' Sweet Sweet Caroline
The notes always been sharp though
Can you swim? No, uh, where the art go
I'm chilling with some gangsters at a horror show
A lot of pot smoke, watchin' Donnie Darko

I've been a god way before a synagogue
Liquor drops used to hit the spot like a cinder block
This is not what you wanted, but this is what you got, you live with what you got
Elixir that I'm mixin' like I'm in the kitchen whippin' rock
I'm in the spot like the middle of a prison box
And you ain't nothin' to the planet but a little dot
That's underneath the water like the line that's on a fishin' rod
Simple thoughts got me itchin' like the chickenpox
Knitted socks, with fingers tryna scratch a lotto ticket off
When I made it, I was gettin' all the bitches off
See, I was faded, now I'm countin' up the minutes lost
I throw 'em back like opponents hit a homer
My mind, it holds explosion like a pose that's on a poster
I'm out the holster with it
I overdid it like the way the roller coaster spinnin', homie, that's inertia
I'm the moon to the sun, how I birth ya
Turn ya back to ya old ways, reverse ya, curse ya, witchcraft
You get nothin' but a whole lot of nothin' with your motherfuckin' bitch ass
You simple as a whistle, never pick a side
Shit, you always in the middle, never down to ride
I was high like I'm born to fly
Never die, I'm immortalized, here before ya eyes
Lord of the flyest, I is your highness
And no diamond when the shine ultraviolet
You on your bullshit, I'm on assignment
And I be on it like a stylus on a PalmPilot
I'm God's finest work, this way beyond timeless
Copped the new presidential Rollie, keep the watch silent
'Cause everybody tickin' me off
I got the world with her legs open, lickin' the box, shit
She home wet, sweatin' me for phone sex
Don't stress, daddy'll be home soon
And assume I'm down low with the post moves
I come through and hit the hole like Jones-Drew, yeah
**** is old news, but add fuel to fire, what I won't do
So, I just kick it with the homies like I'm supposed to
And we go back like gold hoops
Well, this the cold feelin', bone chillin', borderline dope dealin'
I'm goin' up with no ceilin', shit
Out of body, got my soul swimmin'
And no different, good head keep my toes twitchin'
You know Larry been fishin' since he in the womb
This the scoop up the Big Dipper, you the little spoon
Went from invisible and minuscule to invincible, dancin' with the Benes moves
I made a million and it killed me, my second million got me motherfuckin' filthy
You ain't nothin' 'til you die and come back to life iller
They haven't made a mo'fucker realer, Mr. Miller, yeah
Yeah
Alright

Should I do the thing that I used to do back in the day?

I am the melody, who's tellin' me where harmony is?
It's all been a trip like dollars that I drop on my whip
I keep a girl, but when I'm with my friends, I call her my bitch
(Asshole) I'ma need a evolution, just illusion
I'm out in space, there's no one left but Houston
I'm at the studio, I'll prolly take some acid after, but
Right now, me, Evan Adams watchin' battle rappers

Eyes so red that I had to put my sights on (Chyeah)
In an L, out the bong, in a spliff, out the bowl
Yeah, that stinky kush, so you know you gotta have some more

I've been a god way before a synagogue
Liquor drops used to hit the spot like a cinder block
This is not what you wanted, but this is what you got, you live with what you got
Elixir that I'm mixin' like I'm in the kitchen whippin' rock
I'm in the spot like the middle of a prison box
And you ain't nothin' to the planet but a little dot
That's underneath the water like the line that's on a fishin' rod
Simple thoughts got me itchin' like the chickenpox
Knitted socks, with fingers tryna scratch a lotto ticket off
When I made it, I was gеttin' all the bitches off
See, I was faded, now I'm countin' up thе minutes lost
I throw 'em back like opponents hit a homer
My mind, it holds explosion like a pose that's on a poster, yeah
I'm out the holster with it
I overdid it like the way the roller coaster spinnin', homie, that's inertia, yeah
I'm the moon to the sun how I birth ya
Turn ya back to your old ways, reverse ya, curse ya, witchcraft
You get nothin' but a whole lot of nothin' with your motherfuckin' bitch ass
You simple as a whistle, never pick a side
Shit, you always in the middle, you never down to ride
I was high like I'm born to fly
Never die, I'm immortalized, here before ya eyes

Lord of the flyest, I is your highness
And no diamond when the shine ultraviolet
You on your bullshit, I'm on assignment
And I be on it like a stylus on a PalmPilot
I'm God's finest work, this way beyond timeless
Copped the new presidential Rollie, keep the watch silent
'Cause everybody tickin' me off
I got the world with her legs open, lickin' the box, well
She home wet, sweatin' me for phone sex
Don't stress, daddy'll be home soon
And assume I'm down low with the post moves
I come through and hit the hole like Jones-Drew, shit
My old bitch is old news, but add fuel to fire, what I don't do, mhm
I just kick it with the homies like I'm supposed to
And we go back like gold hoops
Alright, the cold feelin', bone chillin', borderline dope dealin'
I'm goin' up with no ceilin', shit
Out of body, got my soul swimmin'
No different, good head keep my toes twitchin'
You know Larry been fishin' since he in the womb
This the scoop up the Big Dipper, you the little spoon
Went from invisible and minuscule to invincible, dancin' with the Benes moves
I made a million and it killed me, my second million got me motherfuckin' filthy

Fuck cares, valet the Ferrari
Bright Vegas lights get alarming, I'm sorry
Too drunk for sex, I might pass out early

Love to sit there and chill when I play the keys
When it turn to fall, she love to go and rake the leaves
Make-believe, used to dream of bein' Ann Marie
Or a model for Maybelline
But fantasies tend to die off when you grow up quickly
Her walls the exact same color as a Tiffany box
Make her waffles, solvin' riddles on her Popsicle stick
If she could, she would leave in a rocket ship
The way she feel got her nervous like a doctor's trip
Mom said she should see a psychologist
Say she love me for my cold-ass raps
Never tell me where the cocaine stashed
She up late worried, tell me, ""Hurry up home""
Eleven missed calls on my phone, woah

Lose your mind when you decide to swallow all Amanda's pills
I pour liquor inside my chamomile
Eat banana peels and post up in the south of France
Fuck, I think I conjured up the wrong shit
Now I'm being haunted FUCK
Must be hallucinating all of this booty shaking
Defeating Dracula then go and post in Africa
Open up Pandora's box and fuck it
Live amongst the rubbish

Apparently the parents didn't plan
Bitch I'm gorgeous

If you could love, would you?
Would you take the risk of being vulnerable?

I ate sushi in twice in Japan
There's not a price on understanding

Maximize the time you have to find the path
The smile hide behind the iron mask (Woo)
I'm alive, I'm alive and well
Will I die?  Only time will tell (Let's go)
Take a journey, find yourself a meanin'
Am I worthy? I am just a human bein'
Full of secrets, stupid dreams
I turn to miracles like turnin' steerin' wheels, I (I)
Prayed for a life like this (This)
Bunch of fake friends and a high-priced bitch
What the limelight is, I'll be fine
See my mind when I'm wind
I've been blind to the signs I miss
Yeah, I'm (I'm)

Okay, time to rhyme with Cookie
(Yeah, uh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I'm asinine, cat can rhyme with the acid lines
And if you haven't seen me spit, then your ass is blind
I'm a mastermind, far more intelligent, I'm elegant
Good penmanship and so excellent
Exercise my mind, now I'm set to rise
Elevatin', levitatin' 'cause we mesmerized
Simon said to rhyme, so I follow the leader
And if you got a problem, you can swallow my sneakers
If you think I won't, you should know that I will
My words is hard to swallow like an oversized pill
You overdose, spit fire and now the microphone is toast
I'ma spit 'til every MCs' bones are broke
An overload of Post-It notes filled with quotes you spoke
You spit a line you wrote, I flip it back, okie-doke
Acknowledge it, words hit you like a hollow-tip
Haters mad when they see me spit, they gotta follow it
What the problem is, homie? We can solve it quick
I spit that acid, know your flows dissolve in it
You'll get forgotten quick, another lost memory
You might be remembered as Easy Mac's enemy
But ain't no one gon' remember your name
I make it snow in April, in December, it rain
Mac's ferocious, and y'all is just atrocious
I'm supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
A funeral is at your back, so get your ass some roses
I'm spittin' cancer at you cats and that's a diagnosis
I flow sick, leave you speechless like hypnosis
And lead your ass to the Promised Land like Moses
 [Chorus]
Easy Mac, faster rapper, master of the craft
It's disaster, passin' rappers, man, I had to laugh
I'm jabbin' cats, they gon' feel my punch
Attackin' tracks, watch ya back or I'ma steal your lunch

[Post-Chorus: Big L & Easy Mac]
I'm leavin' competitors pissed
To tell the truth, it gets no better than this
(Nope, Easy Mac)
I'm leavin' competitors pissed
To tell the truth, it gets no better than this

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo
The prophecy set onto me, I'm the prodigy
My mob is deep, and when you pray, then you talk to me
I spit logically, words like Socrates
Automatic with the flow like Bird when he shot a three
My rap profession and I'm pressin' for progression
Why you stressin'? Explosive aggressive
Messages I send, then I'ma bomb ya
Monsters like Osama, it's karma
You imposters, beatin' me to prosper
I ain't in school from 8 to 3, hooky like vacancy
My legacy holds more power than the paper, see
I'm hot like the place Satan be, cops hatin' me
The federal agency got all they guns aimed at me
And since the age of three, puffin' on the dankest tree
I'm makin' cheese, tell the hoes to get naked please
We in the world that's surrounded by water
Founded by fathers, surrounded by talkers
I'm the godfather on this mic, Corleone
The king of Pittsburgh, so why don't you hop up out my throne?
Or I'll promise, family in black like they gothic
When I spit, your eyeballs pop right up out they sockets
I don't fuck with the justice, it doesn't exist
You talkin' shit just because you got nothin' to spit
I'm runnin' this shit
And in about twenty seconds you clowns will be steppin' from my presence
 [Chorus]
Easy Mac, faster rapper, master of the craft
It's disaster, passin' rappers, man, I had to laugh
I'm jabbin' cats, you gon' feel my punch

Keep it on the low and we can take it off

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love
And I don't really know what love is
I think I'm in love
'Cause I be goin' crazy off one kiss
I think I'm in love
She probably ain't in love with me
I think I'm in love
So I guess we'll have to see

[Verse 1]
Uh, look
There's just somethin' 'bout her caramel skin
And how that chest look in every single bra she in (Aha)
That got me with her every single day out the week (Uh-huh)
We don't even hit the streets, we just stay in the sheets (In the sheets)
Those brown eyes got me trapped
Kiss her on her stomach when she lie on her back (On her back)
She got class, cry and she laugh
A dime with a ass, drinkin' wine by the glass (Aha)
No other girl can make me hers
It's whoever wanna take me first
And she grabbed me, wouldn't let me go
Usually your heart like an Eskimo: cold (Cold)
But she said there's somethin' about me
That she don't want no lovin' without me
Skin so soft like I'm touchin' some Downy
Girl, I think I'm in love
 [Chorus]
I think I'm in love
And I don't really know what love is (Aha)
I think I'm in love
'Cause I be goin' crazy off one kiss (Yep, yep)
I think I'm in love
She probably ain't in love with me (Me)
I think I'm in love
So I guess we'll have to see

[Verse 2]
Look
Check my phone, always text me when she wake up
Sex is real great, always messin' up her makeup (Uh)
No clothes on, lovin' to a slow song
Everybody tellin' us this thing we have is so wrong
And she don't care whatever goes on
Plus she best friends with my mom (Yep)
Keep a journal, y'all know the story, though
The superficial type, love her horoscopes
And I'm a Capricorn that she ain't never had before (Nah)
Her ex hate me 'cause he ain't me, and that's for sure (Bitch)
She got this look she give that send 'em runnin'
She so stunnin', got my heart jumpin' (Jumpin')
And my mind is all twisted
Her lips is delicious for kisses
I got her heart on my wish list
Manager: give her the business (Aha)
 [Chorus]
I think I'm in love
And I don't really know what love is
I think I'm in love (Yep)
'Cause I be goin' crazy off one kiss

So this bitch
Really hit me like, ""How did you get so lucky?""
You know what I said?

Jumpin' out the Camino
Just left the gas station, smell like Hot Cheetos
Recordin' soft-core on her Tivo
Ma, the meatloaf
Re-smoke, got a vegan bitch in the Peace Corp
All she ever do is ask me what I eat meat for—hold up, pause
Always over the quota, boss
Wake up in polo, sleep in Lacoste
Travel across the world, but that didn't phase me
Couple people that I know that happen to play me
Once they start to realize that I'm actually crazy
Shit, I'm actually crazy, um, and

Christian Dior, nothin' I'm ownin'
Go to Hawaii, fuck with Samoans
Get faded and sleep in the oceans

And your bitch wearin' elbow pads
Sell her pussy over Melrose Ave
I've been to hell and back tryna get attached to my better half
Never that, the smile's so gone, so bring the coke on
I'm higher than Voltron, with a bunch of gold on
Caucasians still love me like my name was Michael Bolton
Hold on, do you fuckin' dirty like the soap gone
Froze on, it's bone chillin', colder than the Pope's secrets
Older than Capone's demons, comin' from a place where there was no Jesus
Walkin' bo-hemoth, I increase the feces
'Cause shit real, fly into your windshield and get killed
Buggin' out, had it all, I'm nothin' now
I just gave it away
Fuck a label, Cain and Abel, put a name to a face
Um, yeah, I bust your speakers with some bullshit rap

It's Dr. Octagon, call him Young Phenomenon
I leave these rappers starvin' like it's Ramadan
You all the wackest, my style holographic
Had to put my city on the map, shit, haha
If you a fat kid, go get active
If you a bad bitch, then be a actress
Rap ease carnage, my family ain't the Partridge
Hard trick, flawless, trapeze artists
Take my life and put it in a photo album
How much money do I got? I don't know, who's countin'?
Fake muhfuckas round me, I could do without 'em
You keepin' it a hundred, I could use a thousand
I'm comin' now, call a truce

Is it enough to give these haters all heart attacks?

Child of the blues, never liked school
Been miseducated, so word to Lauryn Hill

In the studio, wonder what I go home for
In my own world when I close the door to the booth
We young and searchin' for the truth

They keep on hatin', I'm beatin' the case
Because I got the code, 'bout to open the safe

Smooth like I'm in love with her
Tingles up my spine every time that I'm touchin' her (You know)
I love her like pussy, money, weed

Filled with green isle like an armadillo's nose (Nose)
I'm sniffin' out the hoes that light the piff and wanna throw
Then we spliffin' up the dro as I'm slippin' off her clothes
Not a player like Pun, there's more flavors to come
No long-lastin' girls, they Life Savers, not gum
But I could use her beauty (Beauty)
They can take her to a movie
But that girl be gettin' more love than Lucy
So I can't complain (Complain), or contain these broads

Shorty got a ass, a body, plus her face is bomb
They runnin' after me, yo, restrain 'em, dog

Rip clothes off and saddle me
Mac, wake ya ass up and hop into reality (Haha)

Yeah
Who's that on the other end of the phone?
Didn't hear nothin' when I said my hello
Oh well, to hell then we go
So high, lookin' at Heaven below
You know me though from coast to coast for smokin' dope
Overdose with the holy ghost, but hold the phones
I hold my own, was local grown
Been killin' that shit since row the boat
Know I'm supposed to hold the throne, be honest
One more drink, I'ma be an alcoholic
I don't wanna think like better unconscious
Need fresh air, everything so toxic
I open coffin doors with a .38 when it's time for war
Told my mama, ""You ain't need no drama
And you ain't gotta cry no more now"" (Now)

[Pre-Chorus]
It'll be alright
My mind on the run, I won't sleep tonight, it's like
When it all goes up in flames, who gon' hold me down? (Down)
And I'm the chosen one
Lookin' all around, what has the world become? Um
The only way to change it is to burn it to the ground (Ground)
I've been gettin' paid
About four or five bitches in the Escalade, let it rain
This money feel the same, I'm afraid that I'ma drown (Drown, yeah)
 [Chorus]
You've never been better than me
From this prison, I'm settin' 'em free
Open eyes, I'ma let you see
This world just like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm runnin' to the edge and when I get there, best believe that I'ma jump, jump
To see if I can fly, fly
I wonder if I jump, jump
Do you think that I can fly, fly?

[Verse 2]
Yeah
It's the life of a entertainer
I need that check, go and get the waiter
Fuck a troll, this destruction mode and these explosions don't need detonators
I met my maker in a elevator, he was headed to the top floor
We're quite similar, we just did our work, but we were in it for a lot more
We would try to change the world, but we got bored
When I rip this show, got a encore
Back when we were still in school, we didn't listen to the list of rules
Wrote a million words on the chalkboard
I don't need answers to the questions of intangibles
I told my homies, ""The top so lonely
But we ain't gonna die, not now"" (Now)
 [Pre-Chorus]
You gon' make it here, live free tonight 'til the day appear
Let's sit back right where we at and let this money pile (Pile)
How do we get rich? If she actin' crazy, you don't need that bitch
Wish I knew back then all the things that I know now (Now)
Go on and on, knew I had this shit all along
Take a breath, feel this moment, hold it just so you can (Can)
Look where we at and look where we came from
When will we wake up? Lost in translation

[Chorus]
You've never been better than me
From this prison, I'm settin' 'em free
Open eyes, I'ma let you see
This world just like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday

To see if I can fly, fly

What I'm doin' every day, probably ruin all your game
Got some brand new clothes, fresh, right out the package
The moon lookin' like I could reach right up and grab it
So close to the sky, I'm high
Was a youngin' who would hope to be fly, oh my

Got they thumbs in the air, smile on they faces
Fans with grey hair and fans rockin' braces
Fans who be buyin' me drinks to get me wasted
Groupie hoes, thirsty as hell and wanna taste it, heh
See, this life even shocks me
I got some people on my nuts, call 'em jockey, haha
And I ain't even gettin' cocky
But if you hatin', I'ma tell you this: Watch me

Goin' to sleep on a pile of dough
Lacoste, Phantoms, yards, mansions
Piff in the cannons, house in the Hamptons (Livin' it up)
Big parties every night
This is the life of the paradise
My main man Twista told 'em right

I'm in the buildin', swagger on a million
Ill shit, in my bitch pussy like a drill-bit

Busy ol' clock in the dark, hard to find time
Spittin' out iodine, rhymin' on advance
Finna burn ya, put the magnifyin' glass to all you ants (All you ants)

Nobody watch you anymore, like Drew Carey shows
Comin' through your stereo, here to cause the chaos
Bitches throwin' bras on stage, hit 'em with paintballs, shit
""How'd you make out?"" (How'd you make out?)
Pretty good, got a mansion and a lakehouse
Millions off of PayPal, in the table at the steakhouse
Man, life is brilliant, militant, still the shit, killin' off civilians
All these white rappers, I'ma never meet my children
That don't go for everybody, just the obvious one
I'm on a boat, 'bout to eat when this tilapia come
I put the cocaine away, I'm drinkin' coffee a bunch
So what you in it for? Pretty sure it's more than a hunch
Wrote the formula for defeat in the form of order and such
A warrior, I'm too much
Watchin' porn on a camcorder while I'm orderin' lunch
I give you more than enough, what?
The young heavyweight, rappin' on detonate
Reading Hemingway, I been a leader, not a lemming, better get it straight
Fuck the system, bitch, it's time for prison break
I been a great, shake it, got you fallin' just for timber's sake
And I ain't Justin Timberlake, but I ain't much intimidatin'
Waitin' patiently, like can't you see? This shit is innovation
Been creatin', standin' on the roof, I feel the shingles breakin'
I'm just spittin' raps and y'all be single-makin'
Unlock ankle bracelet, paper chasin', in the pussy, procreation
Grand slam, load the bases, in the zone, bring 'em home
Been around the globe, done a hundred thousand shows
Now I'm in album mode, everything I touch, it turn to valuable
Pittsburgh, pile of snow
Never gave a fuck about a slut, I pile-drive a ho
Wild lion, tiger flow

You might as well retire, go and find a home"

Hey, then you can pass that, the kid who rock a snapback
Steady blow this hash back until my thoughts are abstract
High to get by, that's how we livin' in this day and age
I bring some color to a world that's filled with shades of gray
Throwin' this cake away to blaze and sip some Tanqueray
Remember spectatin' 'til they picked the kid to play the game
Now I'm an all-star, blasted out the ballpark
In my Lamborghini, speedin', you a golf cart
California dreams, Amsterdam reality
Life ain't what it seems, these the thoughts that weed pull outta me
Blow through a thousand trees, the whole entire crowd get skeed
Livin' in what seems to be fiction, I'm on a balcony
I light one up, this for those who ever doubted me
Then light another, this for those who hold it down for me

When you're young, not much matters
When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got
When you go to sleep at night, you dream of music
When you wake up, it's the same thing
It's there in your face, you can't escape it
Sometimes when you're young
The only place to go is inside, that's just it
Music is what I love
Take that away from me and I really got nothing
Hah-hah
This shit right here, this feel like a million bucks
Jerm, make sure I'm coming through clear here
Most Dope, what it is?
Ladies and gentlemen, you are now in tune to K.I.D.S., uh

Motherfucker, I feel like the hardest working kid in America
Playing with the pros, I remember being amateur
But now I'm rocking shows, see the lights from the camera phones
See my people and they hands is up
Yeah, the game a girl, trying to tease, but don't plan to fuck
My older brother told me that I'm finally manning up, 'cause
I've been a fuckup, if you ask me
But I'm still praying that my teachers gon' pass me
Letters from my soul, scriptures from the Torah
Only give you what you like, I'm a station on Pandora
Rock a sag, my girl tell me pull my shorts up
Rock solid, homie, I'm built Ford tough
Sip a little lean, smoke a little weed
We just trying to keep it cool, so we blast the AC
Some people hate, we tell 'em it's all gravy
Yeah, you got your team, but I'm fighting with the navy
Battle to the top
We in it to win it, we won't stop
No more going to stores, but don't cop shit
Never go another day with empty pockets
Houston, you there? We balling like the Rockets
And now these eyeballs dropping out they sockets
High honor roll, but not thinking 'bout a college
Love with these rhymes, want the cover of Time
Man of the Year, got my image stuck in your mind
Hold up one second
Girl, this my last L, I'ma roll it up with you
Cop some brand new shoes, put me in a good mood
I'ma bring a couple homies, you can call a couple friends
Is there a type of alcohol that you would recommend?
Being young so fun, I don't ever want to age
Haven't came down in the past five days
Just trying to tell it like it is, we the shit
You now dealing with some motherfuckin' kids

You are watching a master at work
Yeah, we some masters in this, man
Yeah

[Verse 1: Easy Mac & B.DuBB]
The rap master, back as your pastor
Rap faster and crack tracks like they plaster (Yeah)
Lyrically gas ya, I'm leavin’ mics shattered (Haha)
Past disaster, onto the last chapter
Yeah, I lay back and chill
My day's wack but still save rap and ill (Yeah)
You think it's wack, then why ain’t you battlin' it? (What?)
I spit, people like, ""Am I imaginin' this?"" (Haha)

[Verse 2: B.DuBB]
Yo, it seems you always on some average spit
Just some average kids, this is hazardous wit
And as a matter of fact, you'll be mad at this shit
Quick hits, rollin' blunts that be fat as your chick
Yeah, me and Mac, we was born to win it
Sendin' y'all the sick raps, leave you torn and finished
Your whole frame fucked up and your form diminished
Passin' raps back and forth, like a ball in tennis

[Verse 3: Easy Mac & B.DuBB]
Yeah, call me a chemist ’cause I stay in the lab
The only tool in the school is a pen and a pad
And Chem as a class? (Well) Well, that’s a lil' bit irrelevant
Writin’ rhymes through the class, boostin' my intelligence (Uh)
 [Verse 4: B.DuBB]
Yo, I got a fetish for the fettuccine, the relish
Embellishin' a cell (Woo) with these simple fellas is hellish
Elders are gettin' jealous, they held us, but Hell I’m in
Testin' us when digestions gets the best of the fellow man

[Verse 5: Easy Mac]
My kingdom is unlimited imprisonment (Haha), I'm sick of it
It's Malcolm, not in the Middle kid, and yes, I'm sizzlin' (Let's do it)
The kid that gets you the dro, purp, but get him the dough first
Sit back, relax, and do my homework

[Verse 6: B.DuBB]
Yo, and you ain't better than the test of teachers
We the best, and we dressed in the freshest sneakers
Ill kids, yeah, we still rip the best to pieces
And kill these haters for they aters 'cause the stress will eat us
'Cause they be bitin' us, excitin' and repeat us (What?)
Tryna wear the same pair of Nikes and Adidas (Dickriders)

[Verse 7: Easy Mac & B.DuBB]
It's a fact, copy-cats can't copy me
I play these cats, fill they cash like the lottery (Haha)
This rap shit, that's a part of me
Why you tryna come up in my sight but tryna fight the kid that's ornery?
You should honor me (What?)
If Easy Mac's who you wanna be, then why you wanna crawl up all on top of me?
 [Verse 8: B.DuBB]
Yo, I fill 'em up in a tight space like sodomy
Peoples be usin' they brothers like a commodity
The world's a lot colder than I thought it'd be
Held my ground as a child, but now I'm a prodigy
And you can blame it on the rap music probably (Yeah)
I been wantin' to make tapes since I was eight
Now I hustle and I make paper off of eighths (Yeah)
I want everyone crumb of the cake that's on the plate, hey

[Verse 9: Easy Mac]
Kick Push as I set sail
Those aren't clouds in the sky, that's my exhale
Save the hate for the fakes and the Bathin' Apes
'Cause we gon' roll by high at the Shady Skates

[Verse 10: B.DuBB]
Yo, Easy Mac gettin' back on some skate shit (What up?)
Every time we rappin' on a track, we gettin' ape-shit
Face it, simple and plain, your game basic
High up in the sky like a spaceship, spacious

[Verse 11: Easy Mac & B.DuBB]
Give me couple words I can play wit'
Guarantee you wanna replay it, stay sit
You can't hate it, damn, we stay faded (We do)
Smoke a blunt to myself and I call it a facelift (Yo)
 [Verse 12: B.DuBB]
Yeah, these haters hatin' so strong, I can taste it
Makin' many claims but the game's so basic
Y'all lames wanna hang on the same shit
Grow the fuck up, I won't pay no patience
So time better spent, my mind's on my money
Been on grind ever since, the size is immense
If cops come around, they gon' find evidence
They start tappin' phones, I'ma lie in the trench
Lay the fuck low, way the fuck low, stay the fuck home
A hundred Gs, gotta pay the cell phone
They runnin' up in cribs, tryna take the cash (What?)
See, I would've thought a home be the safest stash (Uh)
The bacon hates with they racist ass
White boy drivin' through, I just makes it past

[Verse 13: Easy Mac & B.DuBB]
Yeah, we ride by as I chuck up the deuce (Peace)
Corrupt cops tellin' lies, fuckin' up the truth
Scratchin' the surface, cops askin' what the purpose is
Well, officer, we ain't in need of your services (Nope)
I got the weed, no seeds, yeah, the purple shit (That good shit)
Clownin' fools like a circus is, you heard of it
I battle wack cats with the weapons of war
Sharp flows, and they hit you like you stabbin' the swords
I'm the mega, the lord, the legend still livin'
Reachin' Heaven' still sinnin', the ill-written is still hittin'

[Verse 14: B.DuBB]
Still sittin' on chickens, we here, ho
Bumpin' through your eardrums, fuck up your earlobe (Ow)
Yeah, yo, plus I have to be rich
I'm takin' everything you got, I ain't askin' for shit

[Verse 15: Easy Mac & B.DuBB]
Yeah, me and Beedie in the castle, we sit
We just kick back, relax and battlin', kid
Grab your seat belt and please start fastenin' it (Buckle up)
Takin' you on some rides, we some masters in this
I propose a toast to those who came close
And those who oppose, floatin' the same boat
We gooder than good, and better than most
We just chill, hit kush, kick push and then we coast

[Outro: Easy Mac & B.DuBB, B.DuBB, Easy Mac]
And we kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, and coast
And that's the way we roll, so if you roll another blunt, I can pack up a bowl
Then we can hit kush, hit kush, hit kush, hit kush, and float
And away we go (I'm faded)
Yo, y'all hoes couldn't fade me though
So we kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, and coast
And that's the way we roll, so if you roll another blunt, I can pack up a bowl
And then we hit kush, hit kush, hit kush, hit kush and float
And away we go (I'm faded)
Yo, y'all hoes couldn't fade me though

But my money don't really feel like I do
And from the ground, I built my own damn buzz
People was amazed I was still in high school
But now I'm out, and money what I'm 'bout
Tryna get so much that I can't keep count
New kicks give me cushion like whoopie
Keep a smile like an Eat'n Park cookie
Everything good, I'm white boy awesome
Up all night, Johnny Carson
I ain't got a Benz, no, just a Honda

Milli Vanilli but this is really how it goes
Mouth my words, don't say shit
Shh, shut up, bitch, and ride this dick
I'm just playing, let's have a ball
All we need is some weed, hoes and alcohol, hey
Don't forget it when I'm wreckin' the etiquette for the hell of it
Smellin' it when the L is lit, I'm flyer than a pelican
Young fresh, but I'm so damn intelligent
Girls givin' brains 'cause I'm acting like a gentleman

Dream of rocking crowds, see me filling up arenas
This weed got me laughing like a damn hyena
Yeah, I live a life pretty similar to yours
Used to go to school, hang with friends and play sports
Every single summer taking trips to the shore
And that was all gravy but I knew I wanted more
Ain't ever seen a young rapper like moi
Can't believe they eyes, swear it's just a mirage
Still got my training wheels in the garage
But I ain't gonna need those, I'ma go hard (Go hard)
So far I've done pretty well for myself
Couple trophies on the shelf, so what else
Could I want that I don't have yet?
Well, a little more cash and my own fast jet
So I can go anywhere, (Anywhere) anywhere (Anywhere)
Cali for the kush, 'cause boy I know there's plenty there
'Bout to be in music stores everywhere, but not yet

Clean conscience, good Samaritan
Companies send me clothes so I'm wearing them
If you didn't know, well, I'm from the 'Burgh

I smoke herb, then I make music
I don't even talk about it, boy, I just do it

Waiting for the game to wanna let him in, so open up
The boy a barrel of a smoking gun
Whether I'm old or young, the chosen one
I got a hundred billion flows to come
I hope you know the lyrics to every single song
So when I'm at a show everyone can sing along

I'm feeling like this could be my last shot
But many more songs to make, cousin
So why the fuck you bugging? Haha

Peddlin' this medical, the presence of a general
Magazine centerfolds, they all up on my genitals
Got the game in the palm of my hand, it's itchin'
Wylin' out, better talk to your man, he bitchin'
'Cause I ain't got a lot time for these weirdos
Talkin' shit all up in my earlobes
I just live life, try and do it right
Everyone that hear me say ""The boy is super nice""
Put a bitch up on a flight, she gon' be here by tonight
Get some afternoon delight, only eat it if it's ripe
Call me Stanley Steemer, I be givin' her the pipe
And when I'm outta town she wanna see me so we Skype
She might get obsessed and keep callin'
Thirty-thousand feet, Tom Petty, free fallin'
Just layin' back, lettin' gravity take its course
I wanna tell all of my haters that we made it, boy
From basement studios to some official shit
From stressed out all the time to I don't give a shit
Used to dream about it, boy, now I'm livin' it
412, it's the Most Dope syndicate
Had a normal life but now I'm sick of it
Try and spend money just to spend and it's ridiculous
Young and so mischievous
 [Outro]
Bitches-es
And then, uh, Rell wants me to sing a hook like this:
A-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Ayo, Jerm, I need you to do me a favor real quick
Turn the beat up in my headphones a lil' bit

I'ma have no choice but to kill it, you feel me?
Hey, hey

[Verse 1: Mac Miiller]
I want a, a bunch of bad broads, a couple fast cars
So high up in the air that I can grab Mars
Got a bunch of miles in me like a gas card
King of the jungle, bitch, I'm Madagascar
Don't aggravate him 'cause I don't have the patience
Send you home early like a bad vacation
Fuck with hoes that been struck with infatuation
But I be on the road and have 'em waitin'
Escape from reality, life is just a fallacy
So we ride the clouds 'round, skippin' through the galaxy
On the Millennium Falcon, you see me traveling
That's the type of shit to have you fallin' off the balance beam
Way too confusing, got they hearts movin'
Homie, life is a game and you losin'
Better start improvin', boy, get your stats up
'Cause my shit is gonna hit you like a Mack Truck, bad luck
 [Chorus; Mac Miller & T-Shyne]
With my Polo button up (What?) and a Starter cap (Haha)
Keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat (Yeah, hahaha)
Hit the, hit the liquor store to get my medicine (T-Shyne)
I'm in a league of extraordinary gentlemen
With my Polo button up and a Starter cap
Keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat (I'ma tell y'all why they call me McSwagger though)
At the laundromat, at the, at the laundromat (Swag)
I keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat

Louis duffel on my way to the laundromat
I'm the reason fathers wonder where they daughters at
Pussy on the platter, yeah, I'ma order that
Mac Miller on the song, who would've thought of that?
Haha, doesn't matter 'cause it came through
Sky high 'cause I'm in my paper plane mood
Bottles of that Clicquot, that's what my fame do
I get it in, you just claim to
I won't blame you, you ain't a businessman
Gettin' money 'til my death, you niggas in a jam
Livin' spam, me, I live a clean life
Money in my pocket, love nature it's a green life
Double Dutch the same size as Harry Potter's wand
It last a NBA game, four quarters long
And when it's done, we rollin' up another one
I stay with bud like gold stays with a leprechaun

Keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat

At the laundromat, at the, at the laundromat (Koffee)
I keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat (Yo, now)

With my Polo button up and my snap-back
I like the way the beat slaps like [?] stacks
I lived the college life, now what you know 'bout that?
Got so many red cups, I'm your personal frat
Bro, check my position
I'm right above the second place and I don't think we'll be switchin'
Sittin' on cloud nine, first stop in my mission
I'll give you more than you can handle, Michael Jackson's physician
See, I turn this beat over like David Garrard
I'm swagged out to the max like a rich girl's credit card
Yeah, so you know they stay on me
Regardless of these haters tryna air my dirty laundry
I'm on it, I'm sittin' high in the loft
High as a jet for the creator of Microsoft
Yeah, see, K.O.'s the name, it's Famous Few and Taylor Gang
Taylor, like the middle name, what's up?

Trippin' off that leaky faucet, don't acknowledge the leaky faucet

Yeah, yeah, okay

Tryna make it out the darkness (Light)
I wasted all my money on narcotics and fancy watches (Not bright)
I— I been exhausted, stayin' late at the office
But the flow a problem
Mind is self-destructive, rapidly evolvin' (Evolution)
Wonder why I took this acid, open up this book of magic
Never catch that crooked rabbit, he way too fast and quick with it (Syke)
My mental health, I'm doin' well, I need to learn a few morе spells
But bet it's back to business oncе I make it out this clinic, yeah (That's true)
World got me pissed off and rich off of hip-hop
I'm lost in the trip, comin' off of this binge
God is not just pretend, no, he walks amongst the children
But he's hardly a friend
Holy water, Mary shoulda had a daughter (All the daughters are a militant)
I'm overworked and underpaid, was faded through my younger days
So I don't remember all my shittiest behavior (Never layin')
I owe nobody favors (Never)
I'm not your friend, I'm just a entertainer

(What are you afraid of?) Yeah
The leaky faucet, the leaky faucet
Yeah, the leaky faucet (Self—)
The leaky faucet (Destruct)
Lord, what is this leaky faucet? (Self—)
Diggin' up a hole (Destruct)
So I can fill it back in
Never givin' up, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & Josh Berg]
I just wanna have fun (Yeah)
Somebody should have told my dad to talk to his son (That's great)
Instead, slowly I just kill myself
Keep my friends around to reassure me that I'm still myself
Really, I don't feel so well (Syke)
A human sacrifice, bitch I'm back rappin' like I'm Mad At Mike's
Headcase, the basket tight
Dead weight, carry on my back to life (Damn)
Nah, it's really nothin', I'm the black Christ
Half-kike, rap like I'm still broke (Drop that)
Young obnoxious
Josh is probably tired of hearin' me rappin' 'bout my problems (Yeah)
Guess this what the job is (What the fuck?)
Flask inside my pocket
Thought I was master even when I was novice
I'm a human leaky faucet (Drip, Drip)

I'm just tryna wear enough money to smell, with no cologne

Badass motherfucker comin' after the throne
Bad to the bone
Momma tell me come home
Surprisin' all the people who thought I would still be unknown, uh oh
Way too much flow, flavor good gumbo
Boy you do it big, I do it jumbo
Pool like a tugboat
Bars that I lift like dumbbells, life's a businеss that I run well, hey
My world a beach, so I'm actually just rеlaxing
In the comic script, homes, ""happy"" be the caption
Laws of attraction, attaching me to passion
If you think I ain't for real, you can smack me

I'mbgetting fly before I come up at the house
Got enough time to go another hundred thousand miles
'Forebthe sun is comin' down, never runnin' out of style
Huntin' suckers down, think I'm nothing but a child
Give me the microphone, I'll have 'em jumping off the ground
And new clothes, while you're wearing something from the lost and found
So cool, innovative, old school
Calibrating Californication into pro tools
Still eating soul food, still got my old shoes
Still say, ""What up"", and keep it cool if I don't know you
Spittin' rap, these cats wiggity wiggity wag
I'm gettin' cheddar forever, I'm never going back
Yeah my shoes about a hundred a pair
If you're most dope, please put your thumb in the air, like

I'm really high, it's like a fuckin' movie
Except I can't see 'cause I'm so high
Thank you TreeJay for this bomb-ass weed you hooked me up with
Peace, love, and more weed, blah blah blah!
Man, you kids got some... you got some other stuff, man
Yeah man, yeah man
Sound like a weed anthem right here

I say you don't smoke enough weed

No air balloon, but let's float (Float)
We way up in the clouds (Clouds), dancin' on the stars

Vaporizer or bong or let's bowl it

Hoverin' above the floor, I can go anywhere, no cord

Weed gonna knock me into next week (Ha)
We just tryna get jetski'd
A bong with ice, but no Gretzky (Ha)

Travel thirty thousand feet into the sky with me
Smoke 'til you feel like you gon' die with me

Come fly with me, I can sing, I just find the key

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear
But now she's dead and there ain't no comin' back once you there
I hope she knew that I loved her, I hope she knew that I cared
Your food gettin' cold, why don't you come sit down in this chair?
We can talk about all the things we should have done
All the arguments that you probably would have won
But I'm stubborn, baby, you knew that
When you told me you loved me and I told you I loved you back
But now you layin' on the tile, I'm waitin' for a smile
So I'll stay here for a while

Life full of surprises, but that shit isn't fair
Tell me how we live is different, guess this shit kinda rare
Your food gettin' cold, why don't you come sit down in this chair?
We can talk about everything you hate on this earth
And that you're gettin' tired, 'cause you makin' it work
But can I kiss you just one more time?
Baby, lemme close your eyes, feel your lips touchin' mine
I'm sure I've never seen you look more heavenly
Now I'm rubbin' on your back, whisperin', ""Rest in peace""
It's okay, baby, go to sleep

Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe they'll be makin' it big
And I know that life is nothin' easy (Nothin' easy)
One day, I'ma change the world and they'll finally believe me (Hey)

From the outside lookin' in, it seems that I'm fine
But they don't know shit about the everyday grind
Time is money, money is time
They tell me, ""Get there in five,"" but I'm runnin' behind
I try and live a little, go and have a little fun
You only young once, all the hatin', that be dumb
If life a joke, then I'm waitin' for the pun
You all about the beef but me, I'm 'bout the bun, the bread
'Cause I was just a little knucklehead
Now I got my shit together, spittin' what they fuckin' with
If they ain't, it's great, no attention to the hate
Nothin' changed, still cuttin' up, Henny's still my drink
I'm still the same old dude, now I'm makin' moves
It's like everything I do front-page news
I ain't playin' in this game to lose

My grandpa told me one day I'll be everything and more
It's better never to question every lesson that's in store
See, it's a blessin' that I'm gettin' through the door
The money gon' fall, when it rain, it pour
Dear music, you're everything I have now
When there's an army comin' for me, I won't back down
'Cause I never was a kid in the background
Just a class clown, but who's laughin' now?
My moms cried when she saw me in a cap and gown
It feel great to see my family proud, but I make mistakes too
My people always tell me, ""Mac, please don't ever let the fame change you""
They say I'm so different, but it ain't true
Still got the same girl, roll with the same crew
I'm just doin' what it takes for me to make do
And everyone around me gettin' paid too

[Chorus]
When I get old, I'ma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe they'll be makin' it big

Hey, look

[Verse]
Malcolm was a kid at his school, try and clown
Never did his work, just tried to fool around
Said to have potential to get all A's
But instead he skippin' class in the hallways
On any given day, probably showin' up late
With his eyes all red and a smile on his face
He laughed, give a dap to the security guard
Let him through with some bud, never worry at all
Go to class, pants below his ass
Too quick for history, but a little slow for math
Hopin' that he'd be out of there soon
Looked around the room, it was somethin' like a zoo
So, after fourth period, he would leave
Chief, hit the deli, grab somethin' to eat
He couldn't go home 'cause his Moms would trip
Besides, the whip is where his office [?]
Got his bud and his CD player
Comfortable seat and some good clean air
He used to say if he got enough paper
He would probably be the mayor
Or a movie star with his very own trailer
All his clothes tailored, got his meals catered
Maybe he could even be a painter
But this was now, he ain't worried 'bout later
Then he thought, ""Well, an artist don't make no dough""
They tell me if I follow my dreams, I'll go broke
Hell no, we know we can't go broke
Takin' pictures when you can't afford to print the photos
Breakin' Swishers, she was so high
Stuck on the couch, watchin' time go by

Well (Wooh!), I wish life was fair as a renaissance
She was a debutante, now she work at restaurants (Oh, baby)

The stars are aligned, just connect the dots
I’m forever hot, they follow like a shepherd’s flock (Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah)
Me, I’m on my way
The Dads get mad, their son come out gay (Are you gay?)
Woah, I believe in every type of god
It's Thundercat and Lightning Dog, Lightning Dog (Lightning Dog)

Chill out with a sack of the weed, stompin' your hands, clappin' your feet (L-l-low)

Now it's just around a hundred thou' to see me rockin' them stages (Let's go)

Get brain, call my name bitch, head bang like Iron Maiden (Rock)
Need a blessing not sign with Satan, show love, don't lie with hatred
You rockin' with a motherfuckin' genius way before his prime (Prime)
That pussy razor burn borderline porcupine
Just pourin' time with a mortifyin' foreign dime
She just got off work, doin' a 4-to-9 (Woah)

Investigated by federal agents 'cause I'm out murderin' (Let's go)

Ain't a need that I say more, you won't understand what I came for (No)
To inspire those choirs with the highest notes (Ah)

I thought I was gonna get some pussy, but I was wrong
So I guess it's back to makin' these goddamn songs
Told my bitch she was right all along

Well, this that motherfuckin' magic dust
I got a bitch and her dad to plug, it's only death after us
They used to laugh at us, fuck God and castle crush
Holier than holy, bitch, I'm motherfuckin' Lazarus
Mom used to take me into Toys ""R"" Us, tell me, ""Pick one thing""
I say, ""The [?] are half off""
I go home and jack off, we go out for sherbert
You turn around, get your back crossed, that's a curse word
Lyin' on the ADHD test, told the teacher I need prescriptions to beat stress
I just wanna nut on her ABC tеst
I'm as make-believе as the make-believe get
Demented, respected, childhood neglected
In somewhere outer-space, they were lyin', sayin' he present
Nah, he went left

Legs shaved on a new beach in Puerto Rico (Yeah)
Smokin' in the middle of the street like it's legal (Tick, tick)

'Cause I'm hungry and I don't got time to wait (Nah)
I like my ladies fine, kinda how the wine taste (Wine taste)
Hit it from behind, that's a blind date (Aha)
See, the life of a fly boy funny (Fly boy funny)
Always try and multiply more money (More money)

Walk up in your crib like, ""Who the fuck is you?"" (Who the fuck is you?)
Sike, try and be a little modest

Way above the buildin', bungee jumpin' down

Take it back, cookin' on them hoes, you can make a casserole
Mad that I can rap so well, and everything all factual
Ain't worth it, if not laughable, I'm off the wall as racquetball
Dick that keep your girl awake all night, they call it Adderall
Youngin on his grind, workin' harder than your dad work

No, that's my ego, trippin' somewhere where they need a ski-slope
Rockin' in the fall like a pea-coat, freaks with a deep throat
Students run the class, y'all should keep notes
Drunk, then I'm hard to understand, Don Vito

Smell it like it's the shit around me
Feelin' like the Big Lebowski (I'm that dude)
Sick of showin' sad faces
I was hidden in the bat cave where the bitches came in nightly
Keepin' it as spicy as my last name (Mr. McCormick)
I bet a million dollars, show you who your friends are (Friends are)
I don't need respect, just show me where the checks are (Checks are)
The game is full of clones, you stick out like a red Ferrari
Go fix your problems, swipin' my American Express card (Ching!)
You tell me I'm arrogant, I say that I'm certain (Certain)
I talk to my therapist, it ain't really workin' (Workin')
I can't tell if I'm just crazy or a genius (Genius)
You my weakness, it's becomin' inconvenient (Broken pieces)
 [Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt & Mac Miller]
I don't want this to come between us (No)
But right now I look the worst that you probably seen me (Yeah)
The come down worse than the high, Momma, believe me
(Look at you)
And that's true
(Look at you)
You got some problems to deal with and that's you
(Look at you)
I can't even talk, I ain't meanin' to act rude
It's just I'm just kinda hot and it's easy to catch (Look)
I'ma leave it at that

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & Delusional Thomas]
All of your screamin' got me smokin' weed to relax (Weed)
Yeah, some sativa to pass to feed the demons I have (Woo)
I never gave a fuck, why should I start now? (Start now)
Big dreams, small town
Get you while your guard down
The realest — speakin' in facts
This shit is — deeper than rap
I put my city — on the map
I'm rockin' a — P on my cap (Pittsburgh)
Tell him that Jesus is back
And all he after (After)
Is for a bottle of whiskey and some freaks he can smash
(Life's so expensive, hah)
But to me it's as cheap as the fees in the cab
To go down the street and then back (Sir, thank you)
All this fever I have, heatin' the people to ash
I'ma start beatin' your ass for no reason (Hah)
Colder than the snow season (Oh)
Elevation, no ceilin' (Woo)
We all goin' home eatin'
And we done with dope dealin' (Yep)
Everything legitimate, limitless
We all got businesses
I made my way
The eight sideways, we infinite
Yeah, I bet a million dollars, show you who your friends are (Friends are)
I don't need respect, just show me where the checks are (Checks are)
I'm down to bang 'til I'm out the game like a red card
Chill in outer space in a Death Star
Hollerin' at bitches still (Bitches still)
Hope they down to chill at the crib and they freakish (I need it)
 [Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
I don't want this to come between us
But right now I look the worst that you probably seen me
The come down worse than the high, Momma, believe me
And that's true
You got some problems to deal with and that's you
I can't even talk, I ain't meanin' to act rude
It's just I'm just kinda hot and it's easy to catch
I'ma leave it at that

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Upon first glance, I look through the soul, no words spoken
Heart frozen, tear drops stained pillow cases roll over (Shit)
Got over that, built to last
I'ma pro from that to be honest
No goin' back, life's journey
No chosen path settin' sails around countless convicted felons
Maximum security
Only presence felt with is tested
No tellin', send us to death or to the chair (Yee)
In my ghetto, the children probably consider me the mayor (Whoa)
Full-fledged, bein' gangster don't mean shit without the bread
Bread winners association, you not  wit' that, you dead (Dead)
Or deadbeat, fresh sneaks surroundin' my feet (Check on my walk)
But walk like there no jury, get off right
Now let's shake it back from my loss
From the ones I thought thought like me
I'm greetin' they talk like me, well, until my back was turned
Old-fashioned clutch rest and can't handle it, back then turned
All black affair, I learned to order manslaughter
Peep out they flaws, attack 'em
Action brought them bands off 'em
Makin' statements places where I'm hated, flossin' jags on 'em
Out shoppin' out in Calabasas, mind still entrapped
Traps up in every cabinet
Fake bricks and counterfeit money in every closet
Just in case I'm caught slippin', you get me
You tried to rob your mind, plottin' where I'm thinkin'
Somewhat'll be mind bogglin', ten toes deep in the game
Step ahead of the corner, on my head or around it
My aggression rerouted, he had to die
The bitch violated, question me 'bout it
Go to war with whoever love who upset with about it
Flee the scene, jumpin' bonds
Detectives guessin' about me
Where the money come from? (Get on the ground)
Cold cash makin' deposits
Arrest record's shot, I ain't never sentenced for bodies
Motorcycle was [?]
This a rented Ducati
Wide body, sippin' lean when I ride it
Feel like I'm flyin', nigga, watch how I glide it

Don't panic, 'cause I'ma take over this planet

On the net, all up in your bandwidth, no beaver
But goddammit, this sour I smoke enhance it
Got a helicopter, where should I land it?
Been searchin' but can't find it, the things I do is timeless
Where the fuck did this kid find this?
Rhyme shit, hit lime piff
Always see me chillin' with a fine bitch, let her show me where her mind is
Dead silence, it's private, so solace
Want a Bentley and a big backyard
Friendly, but a big rap star
Still show love, more bud to roll up, smoke Dutch, so much to toke up
On a big cigar or maybe in the mood for a doob
If I roll one of these G's up, boy, you gotta roll one too
See, I'm high but I'm stuck in school, don't know what the fuck to do
Uh, self-made, designed my own mind like a pair of custom shoes
So keep 'em fresh, please
Finna ball, 'bout to win an ESPY
Gretzky, [?] your spittin' doesn't impress me
You walk but you got two left feet, drink vodka with my Pepsi

Got a meeting with my bitch, and I don’t want to go

This one right here, whew, this the one
Not you, bitch, the song (Haha)

[Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
Baby, if I don't have money (What?)
Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)
I know you gon' love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)
I know you gon' love my name

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & John Record]
I usually write rhymes in the BlackBerry
But I went back to the pen for this one (What?)
So I'ma let my fingers do the talkin'
And she probably what they talkin' bout (Uh-huh)
Girl, you got to listen (Uh)
I'm in this situation where you got me sittin' waitin'
And I'm losin' all my patience, I just need a vacation (Vacation)
Your friends all player-hatin' (What?)
'Cause I'm the one you always stay awake with (Uh-huh)
Then spend the day with, always wanna walk ya home
And you hate the way my day-to-day is on the road (It's okay)
Front row, know every single song
When she know she comin' home with me, she always bring her thong (Haha)
And bring her lingerie whatever mood she in
Put a movie in, got the lights dim
We gon' make love 'til the nights end (What?)
Have you callin' up ya friends like, ""Ooh, I like him"" (Haha)

Baby, if I don't have money (What?)

In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)
I know you gon' love my name

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I know I take ya breath away, darling
Smooth playa, treat you like a princess (Uh-huh)
'Cause love tricky like parallel parking (Haha)
A business I won't invest
But I show interest in that slim waist of yours
And I smile when I see that pretty face of yours (What's up?)
Givin' you flavors that you ain't never taste before (Uh-huh)
We gon' make love 'til you achin' sore (Achin' sore)
And baby, don't worry, I'ma be rich
Name in the neon lights, haha (In the neon lights)
So how about you give me that kiss?
'Cause you don't wanna sleep tonight (Haha)
Your one night love, gon' get swept off ya feet
Yes, get undressed from your breast to ya feet (Breast to ya feet)
Light a cigarette just to stay awake
Liquor got us bangin' like a 808
 [Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
Baby, if I don't have money (What?)
Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)
I know you gon' love my name

In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)
I know you gon' love my name

[Bridge: John Record & Mac Miller]
Throw your hands up, people, party all night
Celebrate my name in the neon lights
Throw your hands up, people, party all night

Yeah
I eat people, haha

[Verse 1]
Okay, well, I been around, tasted all the honey in the beehive
I be's at the course by 9 to catch my tee time
The 'Burgh is where I reside, the incline, the decline
This world so black and gray, I color me mind
Everything will be fine, they just a little behind
I've been wantin' this since I was knee high
I see why it's dangerous, I did it all ableist
Volcanic eruption, the combustion spontaneous, don't play with this
Fire, bad bitches in the pedigree
Murdеr was a case the pussy gave mе, that's a felony
Black belt, tenth degree
All on the amphetamines, but kicked the habit
Was livin' fast, but now I sit in traffic
My dick elastic, stretch for bitches if they win the pageant
Kickin' ass and takin' names, this is magic
The message is inside of flow that's cold as Everest, not the college
I'm a modern-day Nostradamus
Skipped the bastards, said fuck it, went and got my masters
That's the green coat, I'm stackin' money by the C note
If that pussy on lock, I put it in the key hole
Yeah, I'm talkin' Home Depot
 [Refrain]
That bitch do a lot of work, low wages
Yeah, that bitch do a lot of work for low wages

[Verse 2]
Yeah, okay, I'ma go for mine, you should go for yours
Bitch, I got ten million in my vocal chords
Make another couple M's when I go on tour
I know the Lord, he showed me Heaven, then he closed the door
This mathematics, I'm the illest in the apparatus
Fuck a status, rappers worry way too much, that's fuckin' tragic
Takin' all the medicine right from the cabinet, a little loony
The Truman Show, I'm in a movie
Bitch groupies, tell 'em, ""Give it to me""
But I'm a dog, be sure I'm sniffin' booty
I need all the whores, that's what the alcohol is for
I never went to college, if I did, I woulda dropped out
Puttin' boxin' gloves on, knockin' cops out
But I'm white, I'll only go to jail tonight, yeah
It's the Most Dope summer, 'cause everybody else is gettin' Stone Cold Stunner'd
So, it's ""Fuck the world"" with a Polo rubber on
Tell your mother, tell your sister they can come along
Kill her when I'm comin' strong, familiar like your uncle John
I tell these motherfuckin' busy bees, ""Buzz along""

[Refrain]
That bitch do a lot of work, low wages
Yeah, that bitch do a lot of work for low wages
Yeah, that bitch do a lot of work, low wages
Low wages, low wages"
https://genius.com/Mac-miller-lua-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I know that it is freezing but I think we have to walk
Waving at the taxis; they keep turning their lights off
But Julie knows a party at some actor's west side loft
Supplies are endless in the evening; by the morning they'll be gone

[Verse 2]
When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper; have my own conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit

[Chorus]
And I know you have a heavy heart; I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
But me I'm not a gamble you can count on me to split
The love I sell you in the evening, by the morning won't exist

[Verse 3]
You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
You just keep going to the bathroom always say you'll be right back
Well it takes one to know one, kid, I think you've got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening, by the morning is such a drag

[Verse 4]
I've got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train
If you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same
We might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
But what was normal in the evening, by the morning seems insane
[Chorus]
And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this
The reasons all have run away but the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live
Cause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning never is"

https://genius.com/Mac-miller-luv-letter-lyrics,"[Intro]
Yeah, uh
Let me just tell you about her

[Verse 1]
With no makeup and just a few accessories
She herself around you, that's her specialty
She act respectfully, never try impressin' me
Don't believe in fairytales or meant to be
Sick of cryin', heart broken a few too many times
Had to lock herself inside her room, go listen to Sublime
Just need to unwind, get away, got time
She tryin' to say what's on her mind, but she madе
Now mixin' liquor, the wine is Cabernеt
She just need a place to go no one can find, and run away
And I ain't gonna promise I won't hurt you
Shit, I'm not even sure that I deserve you
But if this ain't love, then it's rehearsal
Ready for the show, why are we sittin' through commercials?
She got her own story, but it's personal
Girl, why don't you speak your heart? We can be a beat apart
I ain't teacher smart, I don't really grieve much
I can give you free drugs, have you roll my weed up
I may be movin' fast, try to keep up

[Chorus]
And I don't really sleep, but when I wake up
Do you mind if I go ahead and give you a call?
You can say no though, girl, you can say no though
But maybe I'm in love
If it's time, would you listen at all?
You can say no though, or we can go slow
 [Verse 2]
Hey, I know I'm young and I don't know the way treat a woman
I can mess up, I promise you I'll never beat a woman
I just need a woman, not a child, got a ass, got a smile
Never trendy, got her style, makin' it worth all the while
I'll probably call you, but expectin' you to not pick up, you out of my league
That's why I wear my heart right out on my sleeve
Every time you in the room, it's like a thousand degrees
Girl, I'll get down on my knees, I've been thinkin' 'bout you
You know-know-know, I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Fuck these hoes-hoes-hoes, take off their clothes for a story to tell
Wanna meet famous people, man, these bitches borin' as hell
You make me feel dumb and lame, never bringin' up my fame
Let me fuck your brains out, girl, you love that game
We've been at it for a while, nothin' changed, been through it all, still in love the same

[Chorus]
So when I wake up, do you mind if I go ahead and give you a call?
You can say no though, girl, you can say no though
But maybe I'm in love
If it's time, would you listen at all?
You can say no though, and we can go real slow

[Bridge]
It's nice to meet you, politely greet you
Pull out your seat for you, that's what a G gon' do
I'd like to speak to you when you have a chance
Kiss you on your hands, show you all about that romance
I know I'm not your type, but maybe not tonight
But you seen the way the kid rock the mic
I know I'm not your type, or maybe not tonight
But if you got a second, let me come and holla, like
 [Chorus]
When I wake up, do you mind if I go ahead and give you a call?
You can say no though, I said you can say no though
But maybe I'm in love
So if it's time, would you listen at all?
You can say no though, girl, you can say no though
I already told you so

[Outro]
Yeah, and it goes like that
And it goes like that
Somehow, we gettin' off track
Maybe we'll find our way back
It just goes like that
Girl, it just goes like, girl, it just goes like, girl, it just goes like that"

This one right here
To the haters
Mac is like, ""How?"" (Tell 'em)

[Verse 1]
Guns drawn, stay on, say it's spawned a kid
Beyond the response to my pops, mom forbid
Blunts of reefer, believe I'm the leader
A different creature, more respect than Aretha
I see ya, wouldn't want to be ya
Look at you, I'm cookin' you enough paper for a book or two (Damn)
I warned ya, I'm the truth like Sojourner
Up on the former, kickin' flows on the corner
I appreciate applause and enthusiasm
But you're an actor to the public, throwin' movies at 'em
Mac is like, ""You ain't half as tight"" (Nope)
So please, cast a light
Let me jog a mic and you can get sacrificed
'Cause I'ma rap for life, it'll leave you hypnotized
Or get ya high, spittin' knives that'll slit your eyes
I can write some shit down or kill it improvised
You wanna fill my shoes? Boy, they ain't made in your size
 [Chorus]
'Cause Mac is like, 'cause Mac is like
And let the beat drop
(Come back)

[Verse 2]
I'm comin' back like a recap
Stay strapped with a gat to your kneecap
Runnin' ya city, askin', ""Where the weed at?""
Turn the mic down (Why?), it's givin' feedback
Hand it to me, I'ma grab that like a half-back
Take the cash back, man, I'll jack your backpack
I smack tracks, y'all cast rap whack
Y'all pussy rappers might as well tuck your sack back
A habit like some acid givin' you some flashbacks
But you can have that blunt, you needa pass that
Where your stash at? The code to your safe
Or I'ma take my dick in your bitch and blow in her face
Yes, I will, I do talk shit and I rap it
Cross me, I'ma introduce you to your casket
I'm a savage, stealin' cabbage from you faggots
Right out your jacket, it's like you never had it
I bust shots in your mug, three slugs
We thugs, this is what the tree does
One time for your mind, Point Breeze love
This is Lil' Mac, shout-out to B.DuBBs

Here is—
Easy Mac, yo
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I start wars like Star Wars, I'm The Emperor
Waitin' with patience in this nation, I'm the predator
And if you hatin', you'll get served with some metaphors
You in the cypher spittin' shit that you've said before
Your shit's regular, I've heard it before
I murder it raw, when it switch, it droppin' your jaw
I'm never stoppin', I got more options than a quarterback
I'm more than that, I'm dedicated, you just sorta rap
A gram of haze for twenty-five, that's a quarter sack
I gotchu on the half if you wanna order that
Yeah, it'll cost ya, I'm not a slave
But you can shop and save if you cop an eighth
Watch the block for cops, cops coppin' dro
Call 'em corrupt but they (Pigs) got a lotta dough
You're monotone, you're actin' like it's hard to flow
Homie, you're at fourth down with forty yards to go
I'm a junior but I rap like a veteran
Get more cheddar than anybody that I'm better than
Let me tell you, I spit the shredder
It's sharp, guaranteed to put the marks in your sweater
 [Chorus]
Easy Mac, but my mackin' ain't easy
See the rapper, instant satisfaction when you see me
Be the rapper but you lackin' what it takes to be me (Yup)
And you can find me where the trees be

[Verse 2]
Cash before ass 'cause I'm out to get rich
Bitches surroundin' my dick, I'm countin' my chips
Without it I slip, trip over the foot that they kick
Ain't got cheese for the trees, then don't look at my brick (Nope)
The industry's infantry, penalties in vanity
The enemy up in the streets, secondaries up in the beef
Chemically, I break you down, shots, then I take the pound
Funeral, I fake the frown, lay you down and take the crown
Had to take a stand against his castle made of sand
Win the battle with the man, takin' apples from a dam
Had to bomb Babylon, the weed you needs in catalog
If you were cream, I had it wrong
Who gives a shits about his mom?
Kickin' competition with the limited edition
And my ambition is to have the proper composition
I deserve the recognition, I'm amazin', definition
Puttin' victims in submission, spittin' each and every sentence (Yup)
Too hot like the pot up in your kitchen
And if you quit your bitchin', the bitches'll stop snitchin'
I spit it ill, sick like raw chicken
But I'm finger lickin', freestyle king, watch me kill a written
 [Chorus]
Easy Mac, but my mackin' ain't easy
See the rapper, instant satisfaction when you see me
Be the rapper but you lackin' what it takes to be me
And you can find me where the trees be, it's easy

But Uncle Sam could never teach me how to Dougie (Oh, oh)
I'm thinkin' 'til my brain pops
Spittin' is a cakewalk (Woah)
I'm just a rapper, guess I'm stickin' to my day job (Woo)
Wiz gettin' faded, come and kick it at a bakeshop
Everything is A-1, steak sauce (Hahaha)

Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Well, my good days are exactly like the bad ones
My bitch say that I defy the laws of attraction
I've always been terrified of endin' up normal (Normal)
Things that we all search for end up findin' us
God is like the school bell, He gon' tell you when your time is up
Shit just end up workin' out, why do we wonder why it does? (Why it does)
Yeah, so I asked God to take me on a perfect day
Swear I saw Him cryin', don't know why everyone sure it's rain
Education system, but I feel we only learn from change
Every time I think about it, shit just starts to hurt my brain
Problems we can't solve always seem to be my favorite ones
Life just gets so boring, playing superhero makes it fun (Fun)
But why is ""heroism"" so close to ""heroin""? (Heroin)

[Chorus: Dylan Reynolds & Mac Miller]
We are what we believe in
There is no such thing as freedom
But what can we do?
What can we do?
'Cause I see the light at the end of the tunnel (Yeah)
It feels like I'm dyin', dyin' (Yeah), dyin'
I'm dead
 [Verse 2: Mac Miller]
They tell you that you need to sleep, and suddenly you do
Scared you gonna wake up as someone who isn't you
We've all been down that road before, poured alcohol on open sores
Nobody can hurt me if I go inside and close the door
Not scared of growin' old and dyin', feel this where the answer lives
You wear the garments, everybody needs to dress some manikins (Manikins)

[Chorus: Dylan Reynolds]
We are what we believe in
There is no such thing as dreamin'
But what can we do?
What can we do?
'Cause I see the light at the end of the tunnel
It feels like I'm dyin', dyin', dyin'
I'm dead

Boy a fool, wonder what's cool
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran cryin' to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to dial?
If you lookin' for a answer, you probably gon' find it now
And to the man in the hat standin' lookin' at his watch:
Motherfucker, well, the time is now
Go and clap your hands, let me hear you say, ""That's the jam""
See, I wouldn't be shit if I ain't have no fans
Can't sit down, kids, you have to stand
Just put your hands up, you don't have to dance
Here, we get it poppin' like it's Pakistan
Iraq, Iran, I have them sayin', ""Mac's the man""
The maximum, comin' through to pass you bums
So if you ain't got no money, better ask for some
Hey, we came to get down, have a good time
Bring the champagne out and the good wine
We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips
Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis
Comin' in the back door, yellin', ""Fuck a list""
Fans takin' pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss
We came to party, didn't come to give a shit
Now sing this part, it goes like this, hey

Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up

Tell the girls, ""It's cool, look but don't touch""

'Cause girl, you're baby, girl, you're good, just don't fuss
I wanna hear y'all clap, just like that

Under 21, but find me at the bar tonight
Hey, drivin' 'round in my car tonight
Makin' music that ain't hard to like

Track fifteen, Man In The Hat
That's the beginning of the end of the album
You know, like, a round of applause at the end of a show
It's really me kinda speaking— I've always had this— this vision of— of a guy in my head, like a old— an old dude who— who's not in touch with this new generation, who doesn't wanna be
It's kinda my conversation with him in a way

I threw some spinners on the car, see 'em rotate when I'm parked
Say you hard, but deep down inside, you know who you are and who you aren't
My California crib, bitch, I'm Mansion Mac
So many white hoes at my shows, you'd think Hanson's back (Hanson's back)
I'm turnt up in a bucket hat
Smokin' blunts that look like Louisville Slugger bats
You nothin', buddy, can't fuck with none of my understudies
Fuck your money, your sister's slutty and plus your mother ugly
My blunt is chubby, America fuckin' love me
Even Juicy J be lookin' at me crazy when my cup is muddy
A little cocky, my hobby probably shoppin'
Armani, Givenchy, Versace bags on the Kawasaki
I'm droppin' shocking amounts and pissing off my accountant
Money's really nothin' but vacations and outfits
And cars, and big houses out in the mountains
Smokin' ounces, supermodels got us surrounded (Got us surrounded)

Soul!

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Ever since a nigga had recess
Mothafucka felt like a grown-up (Soulo)
Momma come and bitch about a curfew
I was still playin' 'round the corner
Seven years old, saw my first porno
Damn, that fucked me up
At ten, I bust my first nut on this older ho gut, but so what?
Let's recap, the Earth spinnin' too rapid
I'm livin' too fast, sinning's a habit
I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
The security guard sparks my cigarette
The old head go 'head, cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look twenty-two
They say, ""You'll learn when you get older""
I just say that that ain't true
That just mean when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us, fool
Just got L's so I'm ridin' high, still in high school but I do
Everything I will do, when I'm twenty-five, no lie (Uh)
 [Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I was young with ambition, fucked around with these hoes (Hoes)
Never needed permission, went and lived the life that I chose (Chose)
Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes (Goes)
Tell 'em all what they missin', while I watch it as it unfolds
I'm dodgin' my death, confident kid
I was tryna grow up with the best (Oh, oh)
Watchin' my step, never no college plan
Found myself noddin' off always on test-day
I coulda been a great graduate
Woulda got one of them hoes from ""The Bachelor""
Could've been smart, could've been a doctor
Life full of drama, little soap opera
Fallin' in love, lucky that I caught ya
Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fuckin' Dalai Lama (Ooh!)
Only eighteen but I had my own business
Then I got fame like, ""What the fuck is this?""
Whole bunch of cameras, fake-ass bitches (Yeah, yeah)
Everybody around wanna treat me all different
Oh, I'm cool, 'cause I got money? (All this money)
Back in high school, none of these hoes was tryna fuck me (Fuck me)
I thought it was a conspiracy
Sometimes my thoughts start scarin' me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets

They, they, they been lookin' for somebody like me
Big bag of weed and a muddy iced tea
Somethin' brand new, wonder what it might be
You party off them drugs, movin' at a nice speed
If you eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older
If you eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older

I wanna rule the world, take care of my family
And take care of my girl, plant a couple seeds

Blast off when you lifted, have you been this high?
Drifting by, give time a kiss goodbye

Hey, welcome back
Uh, we're back with a comedian. Why?
Because we need to laugh as much as we need to learn
And we get a lot of stress, so this helps kind of, like, eliminate a lot of it
And it's healthy for you, laughter's the best medicine
Welcome Mitch Hedberg
Hey, How you doin', Berry
Good to see ya, Good to see you

After that Letterman stint, uh
I saw you a couple times on
Letterman right?
Yeah, I just did it for the third time a couple days ago
Third time?
Yeah

Now let's talk about this, let me
Take me through your background
Where you kinda grew up and
And what age 12 was your first Appearance in uh, on stage?
 I— Oh, on stage. Yeah, I was gonna say
I appeared at zero, but, you know
My first stage appearance was twelve, Man, but uh
You know, when you were doin' that thing
At the beginning at the show where
You were talkin' about my story man
It sounded, way more inspirational than
I ever thought it was man
I kinda got tears in my eye for a minute There I realized things are going pretty Good for me

Well— you accomplished a lot
You were—talk about when you were
A cook for years, and, and
How you made the transition

Well, I used to be infatuated with
The grill when I was a busboy
I would watch these guys cook
And you know, I finally achieved
My dream of becoming a cook
Which was really easy 'cause all
I had to do was tell the manager
""Hey man, do you mind if I cook?""
And he said yeah, you know
It was easy to achieve that dream
And—
 (Laughs)
No, no, that's really a good point
Is that cool? But
Yeah

But, so I, I che— I actually thought
You know cooking what, might be what
I wanted to do for a while you know
But then uh—  since like you said at twelve I star—
I was performing, I was acting a lot like uh
We would take uh
We would copy Saturday Night Live
Skits and SCTV
You know that show (yes, yes)
Yeah man like
Bob and Doug McKenzie
Remember them characters? (Hmm)
They had that great movie called
Strange Brew
But we would just copy those skits
And we would make our friends laugh
And hey of course, there's nothing like Standing in front of uh
People and making them laugh
As long as you're trying to
You know, I mean if they're laughing
At you for the wrong reasons
It kind of sucks
(Laughs)
But its okay
 Now this was in your basement
Or was it with your
Neighborhood friends right?

Yeah, yeah in my parents' basement
'Cause my parents were the ones who
Would always let the kids come over
And mess up the house for the day
And uh we would put on these skits
And everyone was talented but
Now no one does anything in the
Talent industry except me
I'm the only one who survived though the
Years man, through the lean years
You know they all gave it up when times
Got tough they were like 15 and they said
""No more of this""
You know

Tell me about that because every time
I had, you know, you had
Don Rickles we had on we had uhh
Different comedians from all different
Backgrounds and they had many years
Of adversity where they were not
Making it they were getting rejected  (Right)
Why is that important to go
Through that and what did you learn?

Oh 'cause it it builds you, you know
It— It makes your skin tough, you know
And uh rejection is— is real tough at first
But after a while you kind of thrive on it
It's an energy in itself just to get rejected
Talk about that

Well 'cause you want— you want to
Prove people that you know, they're
Wrong man
Like, like when I first started doing
Comedy people would try to tell me
How to dress and they would try to
Tell me, kind of—
What kind of jokes to do
And they wanted me to go to like a—
A standup comedy class and have
Some other guy tell me how to be funny
You know man (Hmm)
And funny is natural, you know
You don't— you can't learn
How to be funny you know
You can learn how to say a joke in
A certain rhythm but you can't learn
How to be funny and I knew that
But these people were trying to tell me
You got to come to class and we'll tell
You how to present yourself
And everything and all that so
So—
Go ahead
So believing inside not letting
Them trying to change the outside of you

Right, right because this one lady
At one point she gave me advice
I got a lot of advice in the early days
Of my comedy
And one lady told me to wear
A lot of jewelry on stage, you know
'Cause she thought like I wanted to attract
The crowd, you know
Just with my jewelry, you know
They be so— they' be so excited that
I had this like broche on or something
They forget that I'm funny, you know
'Cause a lot— a lot of advice comes from
People who aren't very funny
They have they've adapted ways
To like, remain working because
They're real professional
They always wear a suit and tie, you know (Hmm)
So— so a lot of advice I was getting was
From comics who weren't that good in it
I never could take it
You know what I'm saying?  (Hmm)
I know that I had like a—
A different thing to say to him so I—
I had to chill out and just ride out
The bad times like that

So but the— but you talk about
Rejection being able to take what makes
You stronger proving other people wrong
That's the real important point
A lot of people, that devastates them
Yeah yeah yeah
Have you every had a situation
Where you just bombed?
Where I bombed on stage? (Hmm)

Oh many situations man
Pluralize that immediately because I—
I bombed endlessly, you know
I use to tour Montana and Idaho
And uh Oregon to these one nighter bars
I'd go from bar to bar and I'd be the
Opening actor of a two man show
And the guy going on last would
Always kill I would always bomb horribly
Then the next guy would go on and he'd
Have a lot of jokes about like genitalia
And such which the crowds kind of
Wanted to hear they like that stuff
But I didn't have any of those jokes so
I was bombing
But the only good thing about that was
Is a lot of times
These towns would be loaded with
Kind of like, scary looking women and—
And the scary looking women would
Always ask the funnier guy to dance
So I never had to dance you cool
There's always something good
And something bad right?
Yea, I just had to sit down
'Cause no they were too they didn't like
Me 'cause I wasn't funny so
They didn't want to dance with me
Yeah so

Now now now
That adversity helped you
I mean that's rejection
That's falling it helps you kind of
Come back stronger
Do you focus do you learn
Something from that?

Oh uh
Well you just learn that you got to
Get the hell out of here and find
Your right—you got to find
Your audience man
That adversity is like
You got to keep searching for
Your audience is what it does
It just makes you search harder is
What it does
That's good  Yeah

When we come back
I want to talk to you about about uh
You know why you believe that
Jumping in even though maybe
You're not 100% prepared is
More important than preparing
And never doing anything obviously

Oh it's so true man, yeah
You got to like uh
Learn while doing right?

That's the only way to learn
You got to books, tapes, all this stuff
And people but once you do it yourself
That's the real

You can't have a good job in order
To make it in stand up comedy
You can't already have a good job
That's the biggest downfall
Really?
Yeah 'cause you don't care then
You just— you don't care about—
You're already making enough money
So the drive ain't there
You gotta like
Be in a job that's worse than anything
You want that that'll keep you
Wanting to do it, you know

We'll come back"

Yeah

[Verse 1]
I ride the millennium falcon
The speed 'bout to get to a thousand
In over my head and im drownin'
Too many bitches around, they got me surrounded
I'm getting faded right now
I got my head in the clouds
I keep an L with the loud
Fuck what you tellin' me now
Always got something to say, but you never around 'em
I swear these bitches be blowin' me up
And beg me to send 'em an album
They wanna see me on the cross
But, fall in love never the outcome
They'll nеver catch me though
I'm way too multi-dimensional
I'm a profеssional
This shit exceptional
Everything I do incredible
Be upset that you'll never be Malcolm

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna have it all
Everybody wanna make it
Be the greatest
Touch a million
Live to see the dream their chasin'
 [Chorus]
There ain't no rules to this
Can't go to school for this (oh no)
There ain't no rules to this (oh nah)
What would you do for this? (hell nah)

There ain't no rules to this (oh nah)
Can't go to school for this (hell nah)
There ain't no rules to this (no way)
There ain't no rules to this (no way)

[Verse 2]
I'm trill with this
Go to the moon, but to start as a nucleus
Honey, I blew it on stupid shit
Buying fancy accoutrements
Way past human, spend the day laid back
In the way back of a Maybach zoomin'
Better bang that new shit
All I do is state facts
Let the city fall a little, came back to it
Never been afraid, heavy with the weight
Enemy of State, never gonna wait
Getting what I came for
Everybody hate when you gettin' paid
Everybody special
Money is the devil
Give me what I paid for
What you gotta save for?
You ain't got money in the bank
Whatchu sippin' champagne for?
Never cuff a bitch if she ain't yours
But the pussy better pay more
Way more
 [Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna have it all
Everybody wanna make it
Be the greatest
Touch a million
Live to see the dream their chasin'

[Chorus]
There ain't no rules to this
Can't go to school for this (oh no)
There ain't no rules to this (oh nah)
What would you do for this? (hell nah)

There ain't no rules to this (oh nah)
Can't go to school for this (hell nah)

Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight
Say you wanna leave me, it's just talkin', but I know you might (Might)
I get along, I get along, I go (Go, go)
You sing along to every song that you know (Know)
You play your part, I'm playin' mines
You breakin' hearts, ain't breakin' mine
Since growin' old is takin' time, I'm actin' like I'm eight or nine
Tryin' to move on (On), talkin' to my old friends
See me, say ""What up?"" and I'm actin' like I don't know them
Causin' so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that?
Rippin' people's hearts out, you too cute for that, cute for that
I been on the same shit (Same shit)
We run into each other and it's like we don't even speak the same language (Language)
I guess people always goin' through changes (Changes)
Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous

She told me, ""You an asshole, superficial douchebag
Wishin' that you knew that, you could have these shoes back
All of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back
All the shit you buy me,"" she said, ""I want you back
I can't be seen again with you and none of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one, I guess you don't have time
'Cause all you do is grind and it's got me losin' my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to
Think I'm 'bout to lose you
I'ma end this now before things just confuse you
Kept breakin' promises you said you'd keep
So you can leave a message at the beep""

https://genius.com/Mac-miller-missed-calls-commentary-lyrics,"Track 14, Missed Calls
Is definitely one of my favorites on that album
Um, something completely new
I've never heard anything like it
Um, sounds like, you know, some postal service type sounds
Real, real cool, you know sounds that you can't even really
Describe what their instruments are
Um, and that really kinda talks about
The struggle between a dude
Who's on his ground chasing his dream
And a girl, you know, maybe back home who just is having trouble keeping up with everything"

Been waitin' my whole life, I finally thought I should tell you that, yeah
Started smokin' weed again, started tryna read again
Clean myself up, now would you be my friend?
Do I need to know the beginning to see the end?

I lie awake faded, watch the days go by
And only at the lows do I chase that high
Fear God, stay humble
Original sin, we all come from the same struggle

Uh, we look happy, tryin' to remember all the feelings when she had me
Damn, how did she trap me? How it happen? (What?)
Believin' all the things that I imagined
Not only just my rappin', it's the way she had me laughin'
Now she passin' me by, no matter how much she cry
She don't care about the way she stayin' trapped in my mind (Trapped in my mind)
'Cause she don't want to deal with the bullshit
Goin' through my phone like, ""Hell no, who's this?"" (Who's this?)

Let's get away, I'ma let you see
If you can stay, I'ma set you free
They know my name, and my face
Give me praise, give 'em thanks
But these dreams are just make-believe
Why don't you see the world from my eyes? (Haha)
Can you see the world from my eyes? (We got somethin' right here, boy)
This is me, no lies, my life, no disguise (Look)
See the world from my eyes

[Verse 1]
It take a little bit of medicine to start the day
Spark the haze, take a shower, brush my teeth, wash my face
Ready to go out in the world all alone
As I roam, somethin' rolled, bitches blowin' up my phone
She a ho, so no, I ain't hittin' that
She wanna get with Mac just to see her friends react-ion
Say she love me 'cause I'm rappin'
Only care about the money, superstardom and the fashion
It's just me, it ain't black and white
Any muhfucker, any color, he ain't half as nice
They say I'm rappin' like JAY-Z or rappin' like Wiz
But you cryin' like a baby and you actin' like a kid
Hittin' parties, rollin' up into the crib
What it is? Shit, I'm just tryna live, do it big
I got Pittsburgh behind this
Why don't you take a little look through my eye-lids?
 [Chorus]
Let's get away, I'ma let you see
If you can stay, I'ma set you free
They know my name, and my face
Give me praise, give 'em thanks
But these dreams are just make-believe
Why don't you see the world from my eyes?
Can you see the world from my eyes?
This is me, no lies, my life, no disguise (Hey, hey)
See the world from my eyes (Hey, look, yeah, uh)

[Verse 2]
I learned quick that you can't trust no one
Mo' money, mo' problems, it's no fun
I live a life far away from the normal kid
Travel down the road to success and the purpose is
To get some money, cop my momma a Benz
I'm livin' the dream, but for all y'all, it's pretend, ha
A lotta women, lotta weed, and a lotta shows
If you ain't loyal to the goal, then you gotta go
It's Most Dope, thought you oughta know
That's my family, my peoples, my army, bro
See, my life may seem so ""Wow"" good
But I'm grindin' and missin' all my childhood
I keep a smile, can't show it in distress
A glass of Henny and a empty bag of cigarettes
I deal with problems my own way and most hate
Shouts to Sheffy, Jerm, Wizzle and Boabay
Those my mentors, showed me how to get the cash
And this money told me how to smack a stripper's ass, haha
That's my life, boy, I have a ball
Get your final drink in, it's last call
 [Chorus]
Let's get away, I'ma let you see
If you can stay, I'ma set you free
They know my name, and my face
Give me praise, give 'em thanks
But these dreams are just make-believe
Why don't you see the world from my eyes?
Can you see the world from my eyes?
This is me, no lies, my life, no disguise
See the world from my eyes

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart

Said, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie
Said, the universe couldn't keep us apart, why would it even try? Yeah

Before things come together, they have to fall apart
It's been a while since I've been sober, this life can be so hard

True love is hard to find, so I thought I'd start this rhyme
With a couple bars and lines of leavin' it all behind
I've had all the dimes (Dimes) and all are fine
But now I need the one to call her mine (Mine)
You know, that girl that everybody wants (Wants)
But can't have: fat ass, nice eyes, high class
I get the last laugh now 'cause she under my arm
Lay down, hittin' L's, lookin' up at the stars
I tell her, ""Listen, I ain't gon' do you wrong
Forget what you hear in all my songs
My old ways is gone, I'ma be real wit'cha (Uh-huh)
Recently, I been lookin' at the big picture
Perfectly framed, see the way I'm workin' the game
Take my name, I'ma share all of my fortune and fame
Beauty or brains? (Brains) Girl, you all the above""

But, baby, you can be the next to it (Yup)
My boys say I'm stupid, I need to move along
And when we fight, I hope you use this song to get it right (Right)

And the fellas say I could deal without her
See, baby, I ain't playin' around
I don't need Cupid, dude coulda aimed at the ground

Pathological liar
Went to my girlfriend's house and set her dog on fire
Blamed it on her little brother, got him sent to juvi
Fucked her in the bathroom while her dad was watchin' movies
Reach in to my backpack for a fully loaded UZI
Started shootin' up the room he was in
That Chapelle show episode, you know, Paule Mooney was in
Told her everything would be alright
Just don't scream as I dismount
Left the crib, started searchin' for a discount
Exorcist, I need to get some help with this
Once as sweet as Welch's is, think he went insane though
Must have been the drugs in him, he love to sniff the yayo
Insane, could accompany a angel
But maybe one day I can be somebody's angel
Catalog with greatest hits
Sacred does what sacred is
And people raise their brows when you weird as Al Yankovich
I just wanna make out with groupies and play with tits
Snort H and shit, just forget what day it is
I'm eatin' Seder with Clinton and Ralf Nader
Tradin' Acres and bettin' millions against the Lakers
Spittin' out what used to be a children's favorite flavor
Sentenced to hell but I'm out on good behavior
Oh shit, got a new neighbor

Still alive in a room full of melted candles
Lost my job, now I'm in New York sellin' sandals
Saw Christopher Stokes and SW Randall
Introduced my youngest cousin to him, told him he was DTF
They probably had some freaky sex, really, I'm not worried
Already plan to kill myself when the clock hits 7:30
Readin' Hamlet out loud in a room by myself
Givin' different characters different voices, I think it helps

[Verse 1]
It's been a while since I rhymed on a Jerm beat
It's kinda funny, all I used to rhyme on was Jerm beats
I burn trees, dream of selling a millions my first week
That don't matter when you watching re-runs of The Jersey
It hurts me that they think I'm undeserving
About my life, they wouldn't know the first thing
Thousand bites when you been fishing forever
Lookin' at myself in the mirror, ""Get it together"", I'm sayin'
A conversation with yourself is quiet
A silent ride when your mind is sick inside it
Where we go from here, I'm undecided
Polished, divided, we flyin' united
Stay together through the thick and thin
We've been bickering like we was some kids again
I haven't got the chance to sleep a lot
Thinkin' about what happens when my breathin' stops
'Cause if Jesus walks, and we go to hell
We on trial now, got a soul to sell
If I stood before an angel, say I won't prevail
She overdosed on heroin, so now she dope as hell
Princess, I know it's hard to picture
That's what happens when you argue with the scripture
That's what happens when you don't believe in anything
Contradict the religions, believe in everything
And I've been messaging an angel with some feathered wings
My guardian, protecting my heart with an army
And I need every soldier who wanna die in love
I'm kinda trippin' now, and I'm high as fuck
And everybody scared they gon' die alone
This why you go to sleep right by your phone
Waiting for somebody to call you
You can tell them, ""Fall through""

Shit, I just want to sleep
I just want to dream
Will I wake up?
Next time will I wake up?
Or will this be the time my eyes are closed forever?
Will this be the time my eyes are closed forever?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I wonder how it feel, when you 'bout to take your last breath
You can't determine what's real
Ain't nothing change but my address
I gained access to sections of my conscious
The line between the royal and forgot
'Cause when you die they just mourn for a year, then forget that you were even here
What will I leave behind, on a quest to find a peace of mind?
Need the time to see the lines, that I'm 'bout to cross myself
Like a priest before he speaks to a lost soul searching for acceptance
I got my hand on a weapon, protectin' and servin' its ascension into Heaven or Hell
Looking at the space that the angel left right after she fell
It tempts me to fill the void that's empty with money and hoes
I'll maybe get rich off of fucking cologne
Selling love to the lonely, clones take orders but they don't speak
Drones, leave that bullshit alone
Turn my phone off, wander back home
Your home is what you call it though
God spoke to me, it wasn't audible
I couldn’t hear it, the spirit transcended from him through my lyrics
I just hope that I can understand, but probably not when my focus on a hundred grand
And it's been about twenty years since I got a full night sleep
I don’t think I'll ever sleep again, 'til I–

Shit, I just want to sleep

Fifty thousand men died right here on this field
Fightin' the same fight that we're still fightin' amongst ourselves today
This green field right here is painted red, bubblin' with the blood—
Look, look, yo, look

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
They say it's hard to get a deal, a hundred bars just won't appeal
So I'ma start to spit it real from the heart
Spit a scar that you can feel from battle wounds
Rapped inside the womb, now I'm walkin' here on Earth
I'll probably rap inside a tomb with a book of notes and some good to smoke
You can find me kickin' rhymes 'til my foot explodes
They wouldn't know my dreams, think I'm far from it
My mind's in space, to rеmain until the star plummets
Hits me on thе noggin, brain abduction from these ATL-iens
People hear what I say, they wanna tell they friends
How the story end? Sick and closure
I'm keepin' my composure 'til I get myself exposure
Thought I told ya, I remain a soldier even when the world is goin' colder
This a rap addiction, I ain't shootin' dope
Or doin' coke, although I choose to smoke
'Cause if I don't, then my fuse will blow
The few who know what I'm capable of
We ain't related by blood, but I show all eight of 'em love
Some people say I'm overrated as fuck, son
My conjunctions create lyrical volcanic eruptions
Nobody notices the focus is away, this ain't the focal point

We ain't supposed to point up under labels

Hip-hop is a drug to my brain and I crave it
It runs through my blood and my veins, listen, gettin' wasted
These words at the tip of my tongue, they seem tasteless
My heart can skip a beat but it'll never miss a bass hit
Mom says study just in case that shit changes
But, why would I fold when I'm holdin' a pair of aces?
With snarin' aces that vary paces
That carry hate with middle fingers up to those people hatin' on what color my face is

To the winner, there is one hundred percent elation, one hundred percent laughter, one hundred percent fun

Before Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush
When there still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me
'Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'
I ain't know we was on the cusp of the money
Tryna get a few bucks under custody
And my twin brothers was all Syd brothers
So my kin gully and my skin toughened
Thick lens coverin' my eyes now
It ain't bright, nigga, I'm just high now
And if there’s a different way to clear my mind out
I need to find out, I'm doin' fine now
And I don't look as stupid when I talk now
And everybody at the show look astounded
Posted up drowsy

Smokin' out the pound, houndin' mutts out it

Other hand got a cork to hit
All this Ralph be the sportsmanship
Walked in and said I needed all the chips
As well as the one on my shoulder
Feel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor
Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas
Brain still numb from the shit in the soda, so
A generation lost
Facin' a Paul Allen in vacant loft
Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought
And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost
You ain't Superman when that cape is off
Just Clark, nigga, sittin' in his high-rise
Tryna see the bright side of life
And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture
It's like hard liquor, and see people are books
So you judge a ma'fucka by the first page
And a bitch by the back cover
The crime is long-sleeved, so the tats covered
Real ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage
They said my shit was so insane, it was like Cobain did his last number

Here I go (Here I go)
Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary
(Woah, where it's at) I've never been religious
But I feel like the scripture's got it all there
It's not just gypsies and fairies (Fairies)
This could be my last breath (Last breath)
I'ma take my time (Wait a second, please)
'Cause I'ma go out the same way I came in:
Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind
 [Outro: Mac Miller]
You are standin' in a shallow soul
You are speakin' with a shallow soul
Shallow soul
I could drown you with a shallow soul

Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
(It will set us free)
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are standin' in a shallow soul

It's like soon as he turn the block, haters wanna burn a shot
Hate us 'cause they ain't us, we chasin' paper and burnin' knots (Uh-huh)
Tag poppin', swag stoppin' and charmin' freaks (No)
Certified smack-shot whenever I show up on a beat (That's right)
Spark a leaf, pass it to Mac Miller, we cruisin'
Ain't a empire like East End (Triple E's) who do this
Music is on, library is so useless (Garbagе)
So keep it steppin' with that bullshit
He got the three-quartеr length mink draggin' on the red carpet (Come on)
Ear sparklin', [?], staggerin' off the clear vodka
Midnight marauders, you ain't heard? Get your Q-Tip (Tell 'em)
Vinny know the movement, how we spillin' too sick
Got a log, the fog, the whole Allegheny
Enough green, we gon' steam 'til the town is hazy (Good)
So for the time bein', catch us on reclined seats (Chyeah)

Long whips just to squeeze all the freaks in
It's just a little bit of new school pimp shit
Hit you with a little bit of new school pimp shit

[Verse 2: Vinny Radio]
Hmm, how should I approach? A nigga's overhead like vultures
Vocals a bit more cultured, creepin' soldier in my loafers
Pardon the odor from the doja, you and I, hon'
A good mix like rum and cola, you mind comin' over?
Coach her in the code of honor, mama, if you with it
We could make the whip a sauna, that's just the beginnin'
'Cause I could hit it tomorrow, and then again tomorrow, and then again tomorrow
Pardon, I'm a little forward, let me compliment your aura
Your complexion with your measurements is fit for perfection
Just the way your dress is fittin' got me itchin' in suspicion
Plus the way you wigglin' got this whole room in suspension
But listen for the digits, I ain't worried 'bout the phone
Hurry, now we home [?] a bit Patrón, this prone to get it goin'
Before you take this off, wait, let me take this calls

White Katt Williams, everybody feelin' him (Right?)
Hoes is so willin', when they meet him, ""Is it really him?"" (Ha)
Try and make me theirs 'cause they think I'm gettin' millions
Snap back hat on a tilt and I'm posted
Mind like my grilled cheese sandwich, toasted (What?)
Most of you lames can't seem to take notice
Switchin' lanes while your dame give me that blowfish (Haha)
Style so ferocious, the Nile how I'm floatin'
Never did I seem to take advice from any coachin' (Nah)

Yuh, yeah, yeah, okay

Cup of coffee in the mornin', but the mornin' when the sun down
Stayin' up late night
Take a swim with great whites, all I need is daylight
I'm tryna be a billionaire, she tryna be a playwright
Something 'bout this ain't right
Paint a picture on the wall
Better use your mind and you will find there's no such thing as law
Had that goddamn in '09, that holy shit the next year
Standin' on the coastline, the flows a bit too wet here
Most these motherfuckers are so easy to forget here
Toast to those who hold your own
I'm coast to coast through postal codes
The flow is cold as overcoats, I'm blowin' smoke at police
Fuck 'em, we ain't never gonna trust 'em, let me go free

You ain't doin' shit at home
Better get up out the crib and figure this out on your own
If you never live, you never know
If you never live, you never know

Plottin' how to get some dough
Rollin' up the weed and watchin' Indiana Jones, but
If we never live, we'll never know

What's the difference 'tween a bitch and a bitch?
Well, a bitch ain't a bitch when his bitch start trippin'
Shit, I been smart
Spittin' by the benchmark
Wisdom of a Templar
This shit like liftin' with my left arm
Yeah, no need to wonder who your friends are
The Devil probably comin' for your soul when it get dark
So thank God all the time and protect art
Life is the beginning, best be ready for the next part
I swear to God they gon' feel me
Better get a job and get busy
I'm like a God in my city
Don't trust nobody, my shit be crazy
Better get up off yo' ass, somebody gon' pay me
Don't keep me waitin', yeah
And only God can judge me
When all the glamour go away, you only left with money
So I'm stackin' everyday I'm at the crib in clothes that's bummy
All them things you say don't mean a thing to me
Don't trust nobody

Yeah
Hold your temper, the flow can go forever
Fuck these little snakes, I got a cobra on the dresser
The flow is texture, colder than the snowy weather
You don't think that I'm the greatest, need to get to know me better
In a polo sweater and I'm chillin' for the weekend
Standin' in some muddy waters, swimmin' in the deep end, yeah
My bitch is sleepin', but I'm out here livin' decent
Pissin' on a fire engine, got me shittin' on the cement
I'm a dog, but aware of all my flaws
I'm a martyr for the cause
On the run, never bring it to a jog, no
This my job, though
Hit 'em with the crossbow
While I'm at the crib makin' tacos out of waffles
The God awful
Lookin' for apostles
The flow is old and dirty, but the people like it raw, though
I feel colossal
Savage man, I'm macho
Last forever, never gonna stop, no

Hit the road
You ain't doin' shit at home
Better get up out the crib and figure this out on your own
If you never live, you never know

You at the mall getting dinner at the food court

Young boss, bitch, paper in my pockets

Mom said my spending habit little bit obnoxious
But a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit
Used to rock hand-me-downs
Now I buy some clothes, wear 'em out
Hit the club, bitches pull they cameras out
Livin' in a dream, they beginnin' to believe

Open up my closet to that new shoe smell
I guess I'm doin' well
Smokin' all the weed that I used to sell
But once my album goes in the shelves
It's going Nextel how it's finna sell
For now, we're sellin' tapes out my shoebox
Any spot, just set up my shop

I got champagne dreams, Louis Vuitton hopes
Rolls-Royce fantasies, stayin' in condos
For now, livin' lavish is on hold
You wanna play the game, then go pick up a console
It's not slow cheddar, this nachos
I know my path while you turnin' in wrong roads
Hype like pom-poms, tighter than some long johns
Finally, some brand new gear that I got on
New shoes and some twenty-dollar socks on
Me and my people stay connected like a dot com
They say I blow a contact, I'm a car bomb
I'm just findin' me a target I can lock on
Nobody can do it exactly like I do
'Cause nobody I know got my life or got my crew
They try to, tellin' me I'm you
Probably don't understand but you will when it's time to

Everybody mention me, lettin' me get away
From the people always tellin' me, ""Nothin' is left to say""

Makin' money kinda easy when you learn to do it right
Melody through this mic, they tellin' me what they like

I heard the spotlight was yours but I'm takin' it now
You lookin' good there, lady, come and stay for a while
I love to hear my parents say I'm makin' 'em proud
I got a gift to show the world, I'ma take it around
Guarantee you every single hater hate when I smile
Once upon a time, there were people that didn't know
I had talent, I was cool but it seems that it'd never show
I'm finna blow, travel across the globe
And if they didn't before, now they know
Look at me now, I'm gettin' to Europe
And at first, they was tellin' me, ""No,"" haha

I'm buyin' anything I put my eyes on
No bygones, no motherfuckin' bygones
You need to do better, I keep it hot, I choose weather
That's God level, solid, I'm all metal
You soft Jello, I am flyin' higher than falsetto
What's on special? Short bus dropped to the floor bus
Full course, got her pussy wetter than pool shorts
They waitin', never playin' like the side of the hoop court
Decided to do more, I'm runnin' my own shit
I know I look fantastic, I'm so happy you noticed
You should focus on yourself, why your lips so loose?
You talk a lot of shit, but you don't sip no juice
High on opinions, but you low on funds
Shit, it's my time and it's your time of the month
Rhymin' ain't really nothin' but boredom
I just absorb, then I'm on
Gee, I'm exitin' orbit, but more importantly
I'm gettin' up every mornin'
Too many squares in your circle
You way too out of proportion, so act accordingly
Normally I'm torn between good and bad
How I'm 'bout to knock 'em down, uppercut, hook or jab
I ain't seen this much food since back in cookin' class
Let me see what else inside this goody bag
Everything is on purpose
Temperature is risin', my hand is on the furnace
Adventures of a dyin' breed
I was way too high to even try to see
But finally, I'm glidin' on the surface
JuJu on Burfict, lights out, picture-perfect right now
Not concerned with your bullshit, pipe down
I might just pull up to the White House
Shit... Unlikely
The president say my name again, he gotta fight me
I ain't puttin' that politely, that's word to Spike Lee
Somethin' don't seem right, not at all
Little tiny-ass pants, why your pockets small?
One foot in front of the other, I'm 'bout a hundred tall
Overkill, Jonah Hill numbers with the Moneyball
I called a lot of shots, missed a bunch of calls
See the phone, Al Capone, it's on silent
Home on a solid gold throne, when in Rome
Tell 'em all, ""Keep quiet and please leave me alone"""

All my, all my peoples really made me who I am (Yup)
My grandma passed, I was savin' her a dance
I didn't understand why I never got the chance (Why'd you take her?)
But if there's anything she taught me, never give up
My enemies is waitin' for a slip-up (Nope)
So when I'm down, I get up (Get up), the clock is tickin'
It's either rap shit or a spot in prison (Uh-uh)
I ain't got no, got no time to spare
Seats is fillin' up, better find a chair (Find a chair)
Sugar-sweet rhymes from the finest pears
And a lot comin' for me 'cause the grind is there (Uh-huh)

Face-up on Times Square, it look fine there (Chyeah)

And this track gettin' shitted on, spittin' out the ass

Then I'm gone (Gone), things are never gon' change (Change)
Words released out this little thing I call my brain (Yep)

Breakin' rules, haven't been to school in a day or two
Then name a few, 'cause it's killin' me to study
It really isn't funny, seemin' sillier than putty (Haha)
I'm just chillin', burnin' Dutchies while I'm supposed to be in class (What?)
I pass grass to get a laugh, s'posed to be in math
I'm an abstract, class-act cat with my hat back (Hat back)

But how can I sleep when I know reality's fake?
I'm trapped in a dream state
Fuck fate, I believe in decisions that we make
Be great, everything that I give you a keepsake
I don't need a grave, just let me be cremated
Scatter my ashes under the pavement
Put the team on my back and I never break it
Carry it all, I'm feelin' weightless
Your life require maintenance, get acquainted

I hear these kids and they tryin' to spit
But they sound so ass and I am the shit
No, you got nothin' on me, boy

You got nothin' on me, boy

The youngin spittin' like tobacco, sharper than X-ACTO
Knives, flow tighter than a lasso
Louis shades on, my movie star shit
Lookin' like I'm dressed for the fuckin' red carpet
You look like your outfit from Target
With a bitch that smell like a armpit
Damn, that pussy stink, need to keep it clean
Do it like a kids movie
Homie, keep it G, PG-13, TV big screen
Been gettin' money since the boy was fifteen
But I spend it when I get it, Q wantin' me to save it
But I tend to wanna blow it when I make it
Used to drop verses in a dirty-ass basement
Now I'm recordin' at places that Lil Wayne spit
Shit, the future seem brighter than some neon
Bitch, I'm just a dog tryna find a tree to pee on
Infinity and beyond, beyond
Thinkin' you can beat me? Dream on, dream on
I'm so hard, got more bars than a damn jail yard
You slow like them damn little snails are
Now you in space with a star
So just chill for a second, play the background
Haha, it's time to make room for the class clown
 [Chorus]
I hear these kids and they tryin' to spit
But they sound so ass and I am the shit
No, you got nothin' on me, boy

You got nothin' on me, boy
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me)
They tell they friends that they're gonna blow
Once they on the stage, everybody go home
No, you got nothin' on me, boy
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me)
You got nothin' on me, boy (I just wanna one-take it for ya, Jerm)
(No-no-no-nothin' on me, boy, no-nothin' on me; hey, look, uh)

[Verse 2]
Labelled as a young man, don't wanna get old
Little thing called hip-hop stuck on my soul
Bumpin' my shit comin' up to a show
Well, it seems this youngin here lookin' like a pro
Now I look fresh, but I always had hoes
We the style, yeah, always had those
Gone so long, now I'm comin' back home
So many calls, gotta get another phone
Just to deal with the day-to-day routine
But I'll always make a little time to dream
Come with me, you could learn a few things
No, I'm good, don't need a mood ring
Hey, hip-hop's little brother like Phonte
Little league, no Danny Almonte
Bomb haze got me risin' like Andre
Chillin', countin' money with a couple of my hombres

I hear these kids and they tryin' to spit
But they sound so ass and I am the shit
No, you got nothin' on me, boy

Every time I try to explain it, my head is achin'
They look suspicious but get 'em out of my business
I don't need a witness to tell me that I'm the sickest, shit
You try to dance, better pull up your pants
Not a chance you can stand this, I'm way too advanced
I got no reason to stop, turnin' Jesus freaks into fiends when I'm settin' up shop
With telepathy, deep inside your mind, you be tellin' me
Murderin' your motherfuckin' self, catch a felony
Then come back to life just to tell your stupid ass that you better be polite
And treat me like a king, winter, fall, summertime, spring

Well, I'm out of pocket, I know I gotta stop it
I light a match and in a rocket
Send me up to Mars, have them motherfuckers all playin' the guitar
Guess they are what they are, and my eyes be the stars
Comin' to your planet but I mean you no harm
Don't nobody panic and don't ring the alarm
Bring me your info, music I make turnin' walls into windows
Human Nintendo, don't try to play me, don't know what you in for
I am not perfect, I am a cellular phone with no service

No rookie, lot of practice with an actress
Highest battin' average, even Tom Glavine couldn't stop the way I'm smashin'
All directions, yeah, I'll lash you when I'm cuttin'
I'm an addict, I'm addicted to the pleasure, gotta have it
Bustin' out a magic trick, fuckin' like a rabbit dick

And you don't gotta worry 'bout shit again (Shit again) (Woo)
Yeah, brand new crib, who let all these bitches in?
Fuck it, if they fine, then it's fine, we just kickin' it (Woo)
Get the weed, grab a glass, pour some liquor in
Everybody got the devil in 'em just a little bit

[Verse 1]
Oh, used to be so innocent
Used to study everyday, get nothin' but some A's
'Til the money never came
Oh, what a shame, isn't it? (Isn't it? Isn't it?)
This shit feel just like some good pussy
Those days that you skipped school playin' hooky
This shit feel like some head in the middle of the day
Get you wet, got you singin' in the rain
I'm just sayin', let me stunt a bit, stunt a bit (Bit)
I'm just havin' fun with it, I'm drunk as shit
My bitch stayin' sober, so I'm lettin' her drive
While I'm in the passenger seat
Like, ""How the fuck this shit happen to me?""

It ain't a light if it's flickerin'
You see, I just wanna shine, see Mr. Fisherman

And all you lil' bitches, you don't pose no threat
See, I've been around for years, I'm a Most Dope vet
I be stone cold stuntin'
Gotta know, don't guess (Don't guess)
I don't hear none of y'all, I'm so, so deaf (Woo)
Homie, you just gotta let it go, don't stress (Stress)
I just wanna smoke a little weed and have sex (Sex)
When I hit it from behind, see, I make that ass stretch
Only fuck with tens, yo' bitch got bad breath
All I do is get high and cash checks
Call a bitch over, MapQuest the address
Access the mattress, that pussy mad wet
Gimmie head, crack necks
Heard she a ho, we gon' know when we fact check
She like to call me daddy, probably 'cause her dad left
The science don't know what I am, they runnin' lab tests
Got a long way to go, a lot of gas left
Rather have more than have less
I'm in the booth rappin', I'm gettin' mad head
Wanna put it in her pussy and she tell me that's next
I don't fear nothin', I don't even fear death
Keep goin' 'til, 'til my last breath

Yeah
I do it hippo large, spit those bars
'Bout a quarter million, I whip those cars
Bein' rich so hard, sniff those bars
And it seem like every time I make a hit go yard
My bitch in love with my dick so far

You better sit right down, this shit gon' start

'Cause when I'm not at my best
Why does everybody obsess, sayin':

Still ballin' like a Marino

Can you hide away? Can you hide away?

That responsibility is unescapable
Said, I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Yeah, don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
And I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Yeah, who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did I think I'm still myself

People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend

Ah yeah, ah yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Back when I didn't know myself (Yes, sir)
I thought I needed so much help (Yes, sir)
I wasn't yet grown, couldn't do it on my own
""I'ma make it,"" what I told myself (Okay)
Oh, how alone I felt (Okay)
Now they mouth right below my belt
Tell 'em they can go to hell
'Cause this shit just me, don't need no one else (Woo)
My records like phones, they sell (Sell)
No, I'm not done in this ring, better hold that bell (Bell)
Gimme a break of that Kit-Kat bar (Bar)
Who that famous bitch in that car? (Gosh)
Everybody run they mouth about somebody
You'da thought God said, ""Fuck bitches, get money"" (Ha)
Can we get a amen, and a milk and a honey?
Shit's real, how you feel? How you feel? Do you love me? (Yeah)
So let's get electric, majestic
Infected with sex and depressants
This fresh shit the best, just accept it
I've dealt with rejection, a lesson that I've learned (Learned)
All this hatred, I lack concern
'Cause I've waited long enough, it's my turn (Let's go)
Now lift that ass up, you want that match-up, you had to burn (Burn)
I do the work the universe assign me (Woo)
Who's the first to brew the human cure?
You disturbed she'll get peculiar
I was bringin' out juice into Troubadour
Excuse me, sir, I don't know who you confuse me fer (Uh-huh)
'Cause the raps colder than Jupiter (Uh-huh)
[?] Huge berserk, go the distance, Moon to Earth (Goddamn, woo)
Pluto's still a planet
Pluto's still a planet, if you ask me
Flow is crafty, no one's gonna catch me
Where are my idols? Now they old and saggy
Some of these rappers, dontcha know your daddy?
Know I'm batshit, go and blow an addy
Hoes is laughin' up in the backseat, shut they asses up, this ain't no taxi (Hoes, shut the fuck up!)
Throw an alley I oop it, all I do is make music (Music)
I don't take a break, been four days awake
Dedication, no bullshit (Bullshit)

Don't got time for excuses (Ya)
Chasin' pussy so stupid
Swear to god I'ma die in this booth, shit (Whoa)

'Bout time everybody pledge allegiance (Okay)
Thin-skinned rappers have flesh anemic
Give 'em homicide, tell 'em, ""Rest in pieces""

Ride the wave 'til they gettin' sea sick (Uh-huh)
In a league that they can't compete with
Nobody give a fuck who the second team is
Like a broken record, all these broken records
I'm immature though, I don't know no better
I'm at home watchin' episodes of Becker
With a cup of coco and a polo sweater
I'm only gettin' better, breathin' fire
Smokin' on a tenner, keep me higher
My flow, the loss of temper, easy violence
Death before surrender, no survivors

Uh, looks like I wrote this song on paper
First time I did that in like three years
My handwriting is—, is horrible and I can barely read this
Hmm

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore though
Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
Fuckin' girls, but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of all the drugs that enterin' my brain
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police tryna figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops, ""Suck dog nuts,"" haha
Arrivin' to the party in a chariot
Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes, very ill
Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carrey feel
At the amusement park, scared of heights, Ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill? Boom

Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go, these people hate on you
It's déjà vu, déjà vu (One time for the grind)

They say I'm new, nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere I go, these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu

Wind chimes, sick rhymes
Been high on this incline
Tryna get my money stackin' tall, 6'9""
Have some caviar, sip wine
Sacrificin' sanity, sacrificin' normal
Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural
Work four bars that are tighter than your cornrows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the fourth row
Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho-
Dontist, manipulatin' phonics, put 'em into sonnets
Let me put you on this, nastier than Nas is
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna find a way
Spread, like yolk of a broken egg
Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave

Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothin' but some déjà vu

 [Verse 3]
Hypothetically of dope, I kick incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamines, hot, a hundred-ten degrees
Visually stunnin', gotta see it on the LED
When I was seventeen, I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route
It's crucial, three new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yeah, I need my medicine
Fuckin' Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations
I'ma be the best, have some patience
You thought that it was great, then poof
It was nothin' but some déjà vu

Ayo, undress your dollar and sleepin' with the scholars
In bed with good and bad biz for the quali-
Fication to have gems played on the FM
Sleeping on us is not possible, the metham-
Phetamine flow keep them narcolepts all on go
Green light and no smokin' up that green hype
Keep all your thoughts on haze, the backbones for the sound
Well, I don't sound back in the days
The Soul's never outdated
Or overexposed or classified as underrated
Though loved by the popular, worthy of the corn
And when the word drops, the whole block will warn ya
Told Mac Mill, you 'bout to mack millions
Millions of tweeters follow ya
A million skeezers wanna swallow you whole
Just watch the game and make sure it doesn't swallow your soul

Out in Whistler with a goose on a beanie
I'm mack iller, me and Mac Miller, we mack for realla
Don't make me go back and jab your gorilla
Smoke mad kush, always in fresh pairs
Favorite kickin' dunks and fresh airs
Coolin' under the trees with trees
You know the kid 4-5-6, dice rollers, put your bitch on her knees
I'm stuck makin', paper, yo, fuck what you want, homie
The streets is hard luck, we rollin' with sharks only

Fuckin' with my favorite white boy, you'll have your head hit a brick

Hit the lottery, buyin' clothes, losin' closet space

Deliver the rappin' signs of bringin' it back to the golden age
So amazed how I go in focused, I can flow for days
Overcame a load of pain, smokin' on that Novocaine
Love and hate tend to fluctuate like it's Oprah's weight
Motivated off of loads of hatred, yeah, they mad at me

You ain't in my tax bracket, homie, do work

But all I need is some marley lean and the tallest trees
Let my dick show like I'm rockin' Tally's jeans
That's somethin' for the homies, you won't follow me
Plus I'm on that Wu-Tang, rockin' these Wallabees
I bomb atomically but you already heard that
Wanna be like Killa in a mink coat and fur hat
Pure rap with a new way to be real
Word to Cypress Hill, new rappers don't need deals
Fuck a gun bullet spray, my speech kill
Plus my money tall, just to reach it you need stilts
I was a youngin' comin' through on a three-wheel
Now, I'm a motherfuckin' drug, here's a free pill
Go ahead, try it out, have you cryin' loud

Drunk as hell off this liquor, but I'm in control
So, to my opponents: How you wanna do this?
Blood, sweat and tears in this music, I've been through it
No Jay-Z workin' on these blueprints (Uh-huh)
Try and get my shit together, gettin' too rich (Too rich)
And these haters in my ear like a Q-tip (Bitch)
The sound of pennies on the ground like The Cool Kids (Haha)
Music got a substance like a drug do
Chemical reaction, speakers kickin' like kung fu (What?)
So what you up to? Sittin' at the crib?
Turn your system up and come and kick it with the kid (Haha)

Been away for a little too long

Relax your mind, come and sit around
I've been high since the mornin', haven't hit the ground (Ground)
'Cause I had big dreams as a little child (What?)
And I'm well on my way here to live 'em now
Different styles intertwined like lemon and lime
Sit down, then I recline, I'm one of a kind, irreplaceable (What?)
Time, I'ma take it slow (What?), grind, I'ma make my dough
Try just to break the mold (Haha)
I know I ain't old, fa'sho I'm wise
With my eyes on the prize, never waitin' in the line (Nah)
'Cause it's no compromise, youngin who be on the rise
Keep my family on my side, haters tend to multiply
It ain't my fault that I've been headin' up the ladder
You fall down, shatter, and turn into disaster (Yeah)
I move faster, lose a few bastards (Bastards)
The new chapter, who these new rappers? (Rappers)
Cash sign flickin' like a two backwards
The real tend to scare these fool actors (Haha)
So if you got somethin' to say, better cough it now
'Cause Mac's the only youngin that they talkin' about

Been away for a little too long (Uh-huh)
Goin' on and on and on (Yeah)

Been away for a little too long (Go 'head)

You're running low on regret
No tears, that's keeping you wet

Young kid who bang drums, money, don't you worry, I'ma make some
Somebody changin' the world, it only takes one
Never scared of death, but I ain't ready for that day to come
A million people in the world, I don't hate one
Even them dummies robbin' people with some fake guns
Make mistakes, young boy, that's just what I heard
And you don't ever figure out what you don't wonder first
I got another verse, invincible and nothin' hurts
A hundred words, comin' up with what'll have your bubble burst
We can just fuck, you don't need to take my number first
Gettin' right to it, I ain't really tryna cuddle first
I used to try everything with her, but nothin' worked
Got her backwards like she heard the thunder first
These are the days of our lives, and I ain't lyin', kid
Bein' free, tell me what kind of crime that is
It said it can't let me spit a couple sentences
Always good penmanship, make sure you all remember this
You just entered into Blue Slide Park
The place where dreams comin' true, that's where you find heart
Up until the sun come up, yeah, my crew grind hard
See me out throughout the day, but you won't find me in the dark
Say I'm smart with remarks, such remarkable bars
Who knew this music would get me a couple cars
That just sit in park 'cause I'm out somewhere travelin'?
Mackin' on the preschool honeys, you were somewhere tattlin'
Mac has been known to always spaz again
Every single track with him, ""Oh, he's just so talented""
Dream of countin' money 'til my fingers get some calluses
King with many palaces, a fuckin' golden fork to eat my salad with
I observe, askin' what did he design
I see an artificial future for a digital mind
Muhammad Ali, yeah, I'm him in his prime
Just that normal kid in class you was sittin' behind
Didn't really pay attention to him spittin' his rhymes
But now you see his car, try gettin' inside
No, hell no
Haha, I wanna go back home

Keep it, hold up (Can't remember what the day's like)
Late night, can't remember what the day's like

This my life and shit

Momma always told me I was gonna be a superstar (Yeah)
Dream large, you're gonna go so far (What?)
So far (What?), so far (Hey, ho), so far (Ho, hey, haha)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm hands-down the illest to do it at my age (Age)
I can see the words conversate on my page (My page)
The sentences stay jumpin' off the canvas
All these metaphors and my pencil starts to panic (What?)
Writin' so much the margin seem to vanish
Beatin' up a track, gotta get this song a bandage (Haha)
Pictures all candid, feature presentation
Gonna make a movie out of every occasion (True)
They can't stand it, that's why I got 'em hatin'
Blood pressure risin', heart start racin'
Work hard, fuck a calorie, I burn bars (Burn bars)
Pedal to the metal, Dale Earnhardt (Vroom)
Everywhere I go, all the girls say I'm sexy
Tell 'em I can change they whole world if they let me (What's up, baby?)
Get me a million people to speak to
I'm on my way right now, but I'll see you (Peace)

I'm on my way (Way; uh)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I'm on my way to the top of the world (World)
But first I gotta get up off the top of your girl (Haha)
A lot of distractions, no relaxin'
Money, music, promo, tourin', image, and ya fashion (Ching)
All gotta be right, then you get your cream right (Cream right)
But it's work, I ain't left the lab in three nights (Nah)
My girl and me fight, sayin' I don't care
I got a lot of time and she sayin' I don't share (Gimme that)
When you on your way up to royalty
You gotta check all your people's loyalty (Haha)
See, tomorrow ain't hot today
So I gotta keep it pushin', 'cause I'm on my way (Oh)

Momma always told me I was gonna be a superstar

I'm on my way (Way; break it down now)
 [Bridge: Mac Miller]
I got a ways to go (Uh-oh)
But homie, you gon' know my name (Yessir)

So relax, relax, there's no need to worry (Nah)
Time is on my side now
There's no need to hurry (Haha)

She said, I like you better when you’re sober
Why are you so high all the time? (God damn)
And tonight I called you over, I didn’t want to fuck you
I just want to see what’s on your mind
You need to know that I’m a soldier babe
At any moment I could go away
If you could start everything over new, and everything is fine
What would you sell? What would you buy?

[Chorus]
How high’s the number on your price tag? (On your price tag)
Oh, on your price tag (What’s on your price tag?)
How high is the number on your price tag? (What’s on your price tag?)
Oh, on your price tag (What’s on your price tag?)
Yeah, and I really do adore you, I don’t think I can afford you
I am sure that you are a fortune, but unfortunately
Imma wave the white flag (Yeah, I know you like, that)

[Verse]
Yeah, she a little expensive
Got everything that you need in a woman
She more than good looking, she really a blessing
Do you mind if I ask you a question, not to offend you
Should I call a detective?
Sure there’s an angel that’s missing from heaven
I like you just the way god made you (Uh huh)
You don’t need to change a thing (No you don’t)
And I’m not here to save you, I’m just giving you the space to
Spread your feathers, every angel need her wings
You know like it when we misbehave
Teach you, sin, freak you in your dreams again when we wake up
She was worth my money, you could spend before you got
Would you sell or would you buy?
 [Chorus]
How high’s the number on your price tag? (What’s on your price tag?)
Oh, on your price tag (What’s on your price tag?)
How high is the number on your price tag? (What’s on your price tag?)
Oh, on your price tag (What’s on your price tag?)
How high’s the number on your price tag? (What’s on your price tag?)
Oh, on your price tag (What’s on your price tag?)
How high is the number on your price tag? (What’s on your price tag?)

[Verse]
I pull my hoodie down and take a look around
Sounds that shook a town, man, it feel good to smile
So I shouldn't frown when the night is lookin' down
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the smoothest crook around?
Takin' some dollars and makin' away from Impalas
Shakin' the Jakes 'cause they chasin' the face of a robber
Actin' goofy, absolutely
'Cause my passion suits me, so blast the tunes, please
I see the world with four eyes, hip-hop tour guide
Hear the war cries, rap or die
Wanna get signed, drive a four-door ride
Be more fly, 'til then I'll just soar by with a wave
I'm a bat in the cave
Sit back in the shade when I'm passin' the haze
Misbehave, I'm a trouble-makin' teenager
Beat reaper who eats paper to please haters
Seat taker, three-term mayor
Gettin' re-elected just three terms later, uh
I've seen greater days, so let the haters play their game
Dreams fade away when you make the predator the prey
The ace of spades can make it's way to save the day
But from the start a club of heart was diamond
Now I'm in Zion flyin' through the skyline
The game on my back, I got five spines
Black cat with nine lives, time flies by
So I got one life to lose it, but how will I use it? Uh
I put it all in the music, 'cause y'all pussy
Fold away before they hand you cards
Broke-ass rapper, now you dancin' with the stars
I'm handlin' these bars like a simple situation
Bassin' on them cats who don't fit in the equation
Patience is a virtue, but fuck it, I want it now
Get my record deal ready, get Diddy up on the dial
Hello. what's up, Puffy? I'm on my grind and hungry
Throw me to the people, they gon' love me, trust me, ha
'Cause these older cats is gettin' a little rusty
It's time for a change like Barack said
And I don't care, hip-hop is not dead
Spit hot lead, but none of these haters get shot dead
They don't bother me, I'll even play 'em for my wife
Kick back, have a laugh while you complain about your life
Grr, you hate Mac and you say you gon' fight
It's all good, bro, you entertainment for tonight
Like I'ma be mad you hatin' 'cause I'm white
Do a lot of cryin', lettin' pain out on the mic
'Cause overall I'm iller than most of y'all, y'all pussy
Never ever goin' for it all, you scared of a little risky coachin' call
What happened? I thought you was a know-it-all?
I stay smokin' well, haze got a potent smell
It take me back to kickin' raps back in show-and-tell
I wanted to show people, all of my bro's peoples
Have a dude come up like, ""Yo, I know people""
The need for Dead Presidents, this dough evil
So lethal, police'll always try to beat you
Seat you down, try and have you run your mouth
Bring your mother out, ""Look what your son is now,"" haha
See, my mom, she know her son is well
The youngest child, she been through it for a while
9-1-1 on the dial with a smile
'Cause I'm wild, foul child style, haha
Too focused on my grind to ever catch an ""F""
My heart in it, down eight with five seconds left
I want the best, won't settle for nothin' less
And I always stay dressed in somethin' fresh
So keep your head on straight and show respect to the game
And that's what this beat messaged my brain"

So a lot of the time
We have fun and shit with this rap shit, right?
But sometimes, we just be sittin' there
You just gotta write somethin' that, that mean somethin' to you
More than just havin' fun, you feel me?
So this is that
Uh-uh, look, uh, yeah

[Verse]
Recently, life hasn't seemed complete
Try and speak the truth on each and every beat
I ain't in the streets or strugglin' to eat
I'm just stuck in a battle with defeat
I gotta go to school, get a good education
That's just society's expectations
What do I do when I'm feelin' so down?
No more friends, so I sit up in my house
Think about the cars, glory, and success
Momma just hopin' that I try my best
But she scared to let me fly from the nest
Wanna leave a legacy before I reach death
I got my whole life ahead of me to figure out my destiny
Accomplish somethin' 'fore I rest in peace
The troubles that I reach seem to mess with me
Can't keep me up, can't rest, can't sleep (Like this)
Breath go weak, heart go cold
Body feel numb, think I lost my soul
I don't know what the fuck I can do, right?
Try and live life, but attached to this mic
Light in the tunnel start to shine so bright
Wanna change the world with the rhymes I write
Uh, feelin' worthless, guzzlin' this gin
Wonder what's my purpose, somethin' I pretend
I'm just in search for a brother or a friend
Growin' up well 'cause the color of my skin?
What can I say to that? I can't take it back
It's just the love that made me rap
Feelin' like a QB, try and take a snap
Start my life, just feel great, relax
'Cause happiness, you can't pay for that
Mind lost, lookin' for a place to crash
Now I'm back on my own, still rappin' these poems
And my eyes stay attached to the phone
But she ain't callin', she forgot
Some irony been added to the plot
They told me not to love, but I ain't listen
So now I'm missin' her and dissin' other women
My best friends is some forties and L's
I keep forgettin' all these little-bitty stories to tell
They think 'cause I rhyme, I'm like the other kind
Trapped in the times, don't even got a mind
But I'm sublime and so wise
We grind to climb, please rise
And pay respect to the dead
Go 'head, let 'em rest in they bed
We still gotta live, 'cause that's life
It just don't feel right
 [Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
One take that, just come in the booth
And just speak, you know what I'm sayin'?

Every day a different car ride, a ticket on the plane
All the sudden all these people don't be treatin' me the same
Treatin' hoes like a bon voyage, see 'em tomorrow
The second that you wake up, baby, I'ma be gone
I got all the time, I got so much to do
I'm not losin' my mind out here fuckin' with you
Tryin' to travel overseas, blowin' smoke in Costa Rica
Beat gettin' walked on, the sole that's on my sneaker
Keep up, we after the tippy, no ballerina
Rock a show, they say ""Eureka,"" start to do the Macarena
Chiddy, I see ya, we turn 'em to believers
Smoke and get high, it'll open your eyes
I'm tryna do my thing
Figure out who the jokers around and who the kings
Maybe one day, fuck it, never say never (Hey)
For the bars, it's my pleasure, this the best day ever, motherfucker

What on earth are you doing here, in the western world?
(Yeah, mic check, one-two)
Another situation, yeah, you're a different girl (Hey, okay)
What on earth are you doing here, in the western world?
(I got you, Mac)
Another situation, yeah, you're a different girl (Yeah)
 [Verse 2: Chiddy]
We live a fast life, no one told us 'bout the speed limit
We in the UK steady smokin' weed in it
This my Ducati flow, kill tracks, I body those
We player, stay in Vegas at the Bellagio
I'm gone, adios
See what you made me do?
Just go and kill some shit, crazy too
The flow is evil, nigga, Chucky's bride
Pride never tucked aside
When I was just a superstar in my mother's eyes
What changed the brother skies
A slight forecast
If I kill these verses I can get some more cash
The expensive shit, we someday could afford that
I'm on the plane and they probably couldn't board that
I like the way you brought me down and it brought me up
It's early mornin', but I'm steamin', nigga, coffee cup
Yeah, just know I'm holdin' a prize
Before you know it, I'm fire, why won't you open your eyes?

Makin' art with 'em, screamin', ""Carpe diem""
This is mothafuckin' freedom, ain't it?
I came to free the nation
Do the macarena with a waitress at the Applebee's
Who'd rather be a cheetah, and
One day, I'ma be the greatest, retire my jersey
I'm the people's favorite; Y2K, Nelly, Dream Land, Kirby
Have 'em bow down, how the ground sound? Dirty
I'm way beyond okay, these hoes ain't
Worthy of the nut-bust
Up-chuck flows when I'm fucked up
You want a war? Bitch, I'm Chuck Norris with the nunchucks
Lord of all this funk stuff, somethin' like a oracle, I gotchu
It's kung-fu Keanu, I'm the one, what?
Droppin' like dump trucks, made it through the sadness
What does everybody run from? You marchin' through the madness
I'ma kidnap the rap game, hold the bitch captive
Full of so much regret, I should've been a Catholic

Yeah, I'm chasin' paper like I'm broke
Never cater to these hoes, the creator of this dope shit
Got my own chef, plus a waiter and a hostess
Hot as the equator, but I'm rarer than the solstice
Don't trip, breath of fresh air if you want it
They always starin' at me kinda like they seen a ghost
Knock 'em out, T-K-O
Gettin' money is the motive and the pussy just a bonus
Flows is explosive, make a girl sweat like aerobics
Yoga, fuckin' king cobra, boa
Constrict no bitch, don't even know her
Belushi in a toga, house full of animals, Jedi, Yoda
Everybody wanna grow up and be Hova
I'd rather be Darwin, Clark Kent
New G-Wagon with the dark tint
Came a long way from sellin' dubs by the park bench
Now we can celebrate, I want this shit forever, mane

Stuck inside this room, yellin' at the moon
I've been searchin' since I made it out the womb
Did it happen too soon? Did I make the right decisions?
Do I wonder about it too much? Are we ever really livin'?
It's different, I've been sinnin' since commandments was written
I'm a magnet for the static, I can't even tell a vision from a dream
I'm supreme with every gene that I breathe into existence
You ain't in my league or my division
Swear my life is more improv than sitcom, call it like I see it
If I ever log on, you'll get deleted, that's why I stay
Disconnected, creative and respected
Yes, it's hectic but the only way I'm flexin'
Type it on my iPhone, take it with me everywhere that I go
There's fire in my pocket, I'm a pyro
My name is ringin' bells from L.A. to Cairo
I'm so motherfuckin' bright that I glow
Time slows, my mind goes and comes back
Writin' time to hold it all together 'fore I collapse
Lonely when I'm busy, that's why I keep my lil' homie with me
'Cause trustin' anybody else is risky

Surgical but less patient, flourish when the stress vacant
And let's face it, I hate it when I'm left waitin'
Not a minute business, I'ma flip it, so I'm X Gamin'
Condemn Satan, no evil ever penetrate
I'm sick of sulkin', rather celebrate, that's how I levitate
I'm on to better days, Arnold Palmer lemonade
The flow can have the levee break and flood the city
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, swear to god
That's on my mama, on my life, and my entire squad
That's on the city that I'm from, let me feel it 'til I'm numb
If you throw away the bullshit, look how simple it becomes
Okay, the calm before the storm, swimmin' in the ocean
But the water never warm, the temperature is frozen
I'm smokin' on a moment to myself, never tell you what it is
I try to tell you how it felt, how it feel? Well, self-centered
To fire, I'm the ember, let's burn the motherfucker down, endeavors
Okay, my ego tell me all I need is pleasure

Hey, hey, ayy, rich or poor, a sunny day a sunny day
We start the madness as soon as we hit the month of May
Rain, rain, go away
Waitin' for my homie Mr. Sun to come our way
Little kids runnin' through the streets playin'
Poppy on the porch, he ain't got time to waste it
He just an old man in the sea, Ernest Hemingway
Elevate, look up in the sky, stare at Heaven's face
Second grade, holdin' down the corner, slangin' lemonade
Every day hustlin', you ridin' down Penny Lane
You ain't gonna get a day like this
So put to rest your troubles with that goodnight kiss

[Chorus]
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We could post outside for the night
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Oh yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We outside, outside
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high

Said I hit the blunt in the whip, tryna stunt with a bitch in the front
And a fifth I'ma sip 'til I'm sick and I'm drunk

A magician to tricks, make a bitch disappear like her boyfriend
Come into the game, pay up, it's the first of the month
Take what I want, everybody needs some, yeah

And a god gonna shine, turn water to wine

And hopefully I get my hopes and dreams up
Yeah, more money, more threesomes
I go Jadakiss, then go Jaden Smith, no diss to the homie, that's the way it is

Sittin' down with the homies, playin' PlayStation
Tryna find a crib where their parents on vacation

Came a long way from freestylin' in my basement

Damn, got me askin' when I got this fly
The type to change because of fame, I'm just not that guy
Still sippin' on my 40 when the cops drove by
When I go, gotta tell my girl to stop, don't cry
See, I-I-I been buyin' these diamonds
All designer clothes and a Benz just to drive in
Autograph signin' must've got to my head
Fuck that, I've been the same lil' mu'fucka
Always down to share my shit, melody with snare kick
So I don't give a fuck about some lames I rode the ferry with
My larynx is imperative to live, music's what I need, boy
Destroy all of these fake me's, they decoys
Everywhere I go, these companies give me free toys
These random strangers just treatin' me like we boys

And it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop
Thinkin' 'bout my people who was murdered in the Holocaust
Got me thankful just for life by itself
And there's way more people here I should be tryna help
Am I wrong for spendin' money how I do? (Prolly yes)
It's just funny old people see the logo on my chest
You got ya thumb held high? We can be friends

These fuckers lil' bit creepy, so we just leave them

You know I’m at the shows looking good for these hoes
Got they man on patrol

Playing hard to get but she wanna give it up
Yeah, you smoking good but I'm probably smoking better

Smoking, chilling, in angry cars, mean rides

I hope it all will make sense in the end though
'Til then, I'm smokin' indo, slow in the temple
I let go, I've been holdin' onto my pain
But I'm worth more than every dollar that I got to my name
A little richer now, but all my problems the same
Life's different now, nothin' in my pocket but change
Gettin' lifted, I'll do anything that's calmin' my brain
I be in the clouds like a helicopter or plane

Just givin' up and turnin' to instant gratification

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
I'm one drink away from everything you think to say
Like I think he on the rise to what the kings made
And in the blink of a eye, I'm on the king's page
But no album, this is all off of the mixtapes
In a different lane, no signs of road rage
'Cause ain't nobody over here to rage wit', there's no gains
No sleep, no retreat, no surrender
No apologies from me, I'm the penner of the penners
I mean what I speak, so if I givin' you a sentence
Then it be's what it be's, nothin' hid on the agenda
You leave it up to me, and you can divvy up your team
Put your pride in the air and I'm dismemberin' your members
The heart of the city, the startin' point guard
That can play up to the fall, so the parts is all gone
No room on the bench and I got a no-trade clause
So I'm here, long haul, no switchin'
 [Scratches]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yo, look, yo
I rip mics to pieces, cook 'em or eat 'em raw (Raw)
Was bustin' freestyles before I could read at all (Haha)
MCs just call me the monster in their mind
That'll haunt 'em all the time and they thought that if they rhyme
They could make the situation lil' different than the present (What?)
See, I fucked this track, worried that I got it pregnant
I'm haulin' ass, y'all is whack, takin' out the garbage, trash
Duckin' from these sharks and crabs, givin' MCs heart attacks
It's your boy Mac, damn, I'm great
And you gets no love like a man with AIDS
I fill you dancin' gays with some hand grenades
Drop bombs, remove your hands and legs
And I pray; dear Lord please give me the strength
Not to put these little snakes in the tank 'til they faint
Suffocatin', now you choke, you a broke MC
And there ain't nothin' left to do but just smoke up your weed, like

I know people that try, people that don't
People that fly through the air, just float like smoke
I know people that joke, know people that's rich, know people that's broke
Know people that love, people that hate
Some tell you that you good, some say you doin' great
Hey, I know people can't wait
They wanna hear every single thing I gotta say
Some people act cool, some act phony
People are your friends, but they never be your homies
I know people think they know me
Like there's a lame, untalented old me
Girls wanna own me, labels wanna clone me
Haters wanna choke me, stoners wanna smoke weed
People never gonna change
'Cause no two people are the same, hey

[Chorus]
We, we are just two people
What more can we do?
Give me one more day
I'ma spend it with you, with you

[Verse 2]
I can't complain that people know my name
And when I come back home, not a damn thing change
I bet people can't believe
Some after the money, some want a degree
If you showin' love, then you cool with me
I'm the same old dude before the jewelry
And everything kinda new to me
Things ain't nothin' like they used to be
People thought I wouldn't
Some people probably thought I could
Some people think the boy turned to Hollywood
Live it up, every day worthwhile
Dudes run away when they see the girl smile
I'm glad I get to call her mine
These the type of things so hard to find
You can't tell a star to shine or a carpet fly
Shit's gonna happen, it's just all in time
 [Chorus]
We, we are just two people
What more can we do?
Give me one more day
I'ma spend it with you, with you

[Bridge]
I'm dealin' with somebody, and I don’t know what to do
They may not understand you 'cause they see you on the move
Girl, this dinner's over, I'm tryna get you to my room
'Cause I've been goin' crazy, baby, you don't got a clue

We, we are just two people
What more can we do?
Give me one more day

Hey
Microphone testing, uh, testing
You playin' politician, you Martin Sheen on The West Wing
Guessing the best thing for me to do is spit it
This shit is never a gimmick, you listen more than a minute
I been spittin' flows since the kid was six-years-old
And if you listen close, I do this like some mismatched clothes
It's whatever, put it together, you never could be this clever
I'm rockin' the mic forever, you gonna stop me never
I'm cocky because I love it, you Rocky without the punches
Hockey without the ice and boxes without the lunches
Flowin' like me, no one, and that got you mad, bitch
Saw your boys are nothin' but just a-verage
I ain't tellin' nobody how they should live they life
I got my own shit to deal with, so that just isn't right
I'm just tryna leave the crib, go out and live tonight
Shit, fuck that, I'm locked in the lab, workin'
Droppin' a track, beats get bodied and bagged, certain
See the world through first, second, and third-person
Omniscient, listenin' so efficient
Trapped in my own goal line, ready to go the distance
Consider it a privilege that you get to witness

Good evening everybody
How y'all doing tonight?
Currently in Paris, smokin' cigarettes on a terrace
Alright look

[Chorus]
Uh, never was egotistical
Meeting people that never seemed to really believe in you
But they don’t understand the things that genius do
Suicidal thoughts, yeah I keep a few
Speakin' to the people who exist in my head
I'm only speakin' to the people who exist in my head
Only speakin' to the peoplе who exist in my head
I'm only speakin' to thе people who exist in my head

[Verse 1]
Okay, yeah
In the beginning of time, before we could find
The things in our mind and explain them
Had to be given a reason for breathin'
We slippin' and dreamin' of river and seas
Didn't it all seem a little bit easier back then?
Rappin' was all but a hobby, I'm takin' it back to that
I have me an army, arms bleed with anguish
This tug-of-war that's killin' me
I know I'm strong enough to [?] it's takin' its toll
On this concrete, my brain sits
Drugs explore the feelings
See, they lasted long enough to make me break from the mould
Take this and go, run and tell the others 'bout us
It could save me a soul, I want it just to fuck around with
They wonder what my sound is, and ask me who I'm down with
These countless questions 'bout complexions, yet the answer I don't know
He a bitch, he a faggot, he a pussy, he a cracker, he a back-packer
Fuck it I'm a frat-rappin, ass-kissed, dick-rider, miss-guided, anti-violence minded lame
Problem with America, cryin' shame
A lot of people tryna deny the times of change
Close their minds, just believe lies, and hideaway
I hustle hard on my fuckin' job, slave to the dollar
A dog tryna catch my tail with twenties in my collar
Sick in the head, spending days I wish I was dead
Paranoia got me thinkin' every bitch with the feds
I want to kill them, but I kiss them instead
Lick on 'em breasts, ego
She love my dick when it flex, ahaha
I'm hitting the sess, stressin' 'cause my shit is a mess
Hundred bodies, different sins, I guess I didn't confess
Shit, my mind, I gotta give it a rest
Remember there ain't no pretending when you're sitting with death
Okay, so give me the checks
I don't want shit with the rest
They don't want it if it isn't the best, God bless
Okay, as we go back in time

Uh, never was egotistical
Meeting people that never seemed to really believe in you
But they don’t understand the things that genius do
Suicidal thoughts, yeah I keep a few
Speakin' to the people who exist in my head
I'm only speakin' to the people who exist in my head
Only speakin' to the people who exist in my head
I'm only speakin' to the people who exist in my head

[Verse 2]
Okay, yeah
Candyman, Candyman deliver a dream
Put a message in the bottle, throw it into the stream
Tell the soldiers I ain't running, better send a regime
And if the Senate can't comply, better bring me the king
I speak the native tongue, the ancestor's language
Got a ex-girl that's crazier than Cobain's bitch
Ancient Saints that sat with the Masons
I told God, ""Let me in"", He said patience
I'm rearrangin' the Order of Operations
Align planets, black holes where the time vanish
Good paintings on a dry canvas
Chaos, cause revolution, let the mind panic
My, how things differ
Stirrin' shit up while usin' the Big Dipper
I was in Pittsburgh, struggled to find a listener
Then I had me a Mercedes like Val Kilmer
Woah, go and research that
Stop thinkin', move three words back
Someone told me that keys open doors
The lowest of the lows, I'm beneath the ocean floors
South, West, East to the North
Me and my homies smokin' weed on my porch
Who do you believe in the most?
I'ma listen while I snort this whole kilo of coke, uh
Drug addict who cut classes, and used bus passes to explore the world because he loved madness
The baddest motherfucker out
Told my bitch to lay down, let me fuck her mouth
I love my bitches over thirty, cougars
Who like to talk dirty when they message my computer
Keepin' my imagination runnin'
All need is a couple of videos, and I’ll be comin' around a mountain, the fountain of youth is now polluted
I fucked Selena Gomez and bust a nut on her forehead
Still crushing Jennifer Lopez
Wanna set the camera up and have gross sex
 [Chorus]
Uh, never was egotistical
Meetin' people that never seemed to really believe in you
But they don't understand the things that genius do
Suicidal thoughts, yeah I keep a few
Speakin' to the people who exist in my head
I'm only speakin' to the people who exist in my head
Only speakin' to the people who exist in my head

Ooh
Ooh (Fuck you) Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I came for whoever is in charge (Here)
Suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard (Here)
They need some coffee, everybody sleepin' on me
Goin' round door-to-door, settin' off alarms (Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep)
All that horse shit, you shoulda left it at the barn
Keep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah
Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made (That's the ball game)
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase
Me and my bizarre ways (Lord have mercy)
I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant, you can see it from the scarface
Hidden in a dark place, swimmin' in a shark tank
Give a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in a arcade
(Time crisis) Not a second to lose
I'm the motherfuckin' Bible, that's forever the truth (Amen)
And this is not another case of the celebrity blues
The devil wit' me and he tell me to shoot, boom
 [Chorus: Mac Miller]
Murder, murder, murder, murder (Oh yeah), what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for somethin' to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall (I do)
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all (I do)
Got what you need if you like breakin' the law
My mother raised me a god (Hey)
(Fuck you)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, blame the drugs, got me sinnin' on a weekday
Drunk as fuck, do a buck sixty on the freeway (Skrrt)
Givin' y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase
That's hidden in a subwoofer, beat case
Used to wanna know how a freak taste
Now I'm in it in an instant like replay
Broad's a baton, pass her off like relay
Why I'm so mad on my B-Day?, she say
""I thought you got sober,"" then I said
""I wish you'd stop bein' a bitch and get to mindin' your business""
Told me, ""Money has changed ya""
I get to thinkin', how rarely do I visit? How'd I get so egotistical?
I'm a Buffalo Soldier
Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer
I'm only twenty-three but my mind is older, and it'll forever be
Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies
 [Chorus: Mac Miller]
Murder, murder, murder, murder (Oh yeah), what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for somethin' to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?

Leave it to me, I do enough for us all

A goddess told me ""Good mornin'"" when I woke up (Fuck you)
You know I had a good mornin' when I woke up (Fuck you)
Gotta thank God every mornin', then I woke up (Good; Fuck you)

I've been a sinner, I'm just tryna stay
Warm through the winter, and I'll be on my way

I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind

Ah, yeah
I thought I'd have it figured out by now
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past by now
Me and the homies would be sittin' on millions
Reminiscin' on times when we were so broke and livin' in Oakland just chillin'
I thought I'd have it in the bag by now
I thought that we'd be kickin' back by now
I know that life is a bitch, I know that life is a bitch
I thought we'd put her in a cab by now
But I'm stressin', I can't relax
Swallowin' my pride and I'm hidin' what's makin' me mad
Everybody sayin' I need rehab
'Cause I'm speedin' with a blindfold on
It won't be long until they watchin' me crash
And they don't wanna see that
They don't want me to OD and have to talk to my mother
Tell her they coulda done more to help me
And she'd just be cryin', sayin' that she'd do anything to have me back
All the nights I'm losin' sleep
It was all a dream, there was a time that I believed that
But white lines be numbin' them dark times
The pills that I'm poppin', I need to man up
Admit it's a problem, I need to wake up
Before one mornin' I don't wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I'm too obsessed with goin' down as a great one
But if you wait too long, they gon' find someone to replace ya
So I guess this is a letter
To all my brothers, Most Dope, that's forever
I love you more than words could express
And this the part that Q start cryin' if he ain't already yet
I did my best to be a leader you respect
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret
So tell my baby I love her
And if she give me the chance, I'll put a seed inside her, make her a mother
Just know that there's a place
Where all my people worry free and e'rybody straight
Every devil don't got horns, every hero ain't got capes
Open up my eyes, shit, I'm finally awake, good mornin'
Yeah, good mornin'

Yo, Vin, it's the morning, you gotta go to work
Alright
Yo, you gotta, you gotta be at work in like ten minutes, yo
I'm good, man
You good?
I'm straight, yo, what's good?

You gotta go pick up the dry cleaning and shit still?
Man, fuck that shit, I'll skip
You 'bout to go to work?

I'm worldwide, but I smack clowns local

Fire in the hole of the designer of your clothes
On the up and up, you fuckin' up, why you fuckin' with those?
Planet of the apes, the survival of the goons
I'm so dope, you could put the lighter on the spoon
I'm tightest with the tunes, need a verse and I write it, son
Master shit with no practice, bitch, Al Iverson
Fuck the king of New York, in my presence they all peasants
The king is all talk
Whoever holdin' the crown
Better pass that shit to me, P, I'm holdin' it down
Fuck if you the greatest
A lot of rappers got killed, fuck around and be the latest
Your bars warm, my shit smokin'
I pitch Knicks at my pace, I'm Chris Copeland

Some of y'all need to just smoke some weed and see if it don't help the quality of your motherfuckin' life. I know, I see some of y'all. Look, I understand, if you ain't smokin' weed 'cause you got a good job, then by all means make your paper, boo-boo, but if you ain't got no job and you not smokin' weed, I don't know what the fuck you are doin' with your life. I really don't. I really don't. Don't give me that shit about ""It's a drug!"", it ain't no motherfuckin' drug, I done done the research, it's just a plant. It just grow like that, and if you just so happen to set it on fire, there are some effects. Do you want to get high?

[Intro]
This intro's fuckin' funny as hell
I wanna get blunted, my brother
Tick-tock motherfuckers
Greetings
I wanna get blunted, my brother
I hope you're high if you're listenin' to this shit
Hey
Hey, you
Why'd you stop rollin' up that weed?
Yeah, that's right

[Chorus]
Some days I be feelin' like I am the shit (I am the shit)
Wearin' clothes right out the package
Lookin' how nice they fit (How nice they fit)
And I swear I'ma be the fuckin' dopest
As long as I can stay up on my grind (Stay up on my grind)
I'ma always know where my home is (Home is)
I've got a Pittsburgh state of mind (State of mind)

[Verse 1]
Hey
Ayo, I'm comin' a—, comin' a—, comin' a—, comin' a—, comin' around again
Runnin' a—, runnin' around with them
Me and a thousand of my friends
Gettin' lifted, dazed and confused, and controllin' this stick shift
I’ve been workin' hard, baby, feelin' like it's my sixth shift
Dealin' with different situations, gettin' a bit of congratulations
Sick with the rhymes, splittin' your minds, feelin' the good vibrations
Excitement, you see these different places I'm invited
While you writin', it's in the people’s ears, they callin' you Tyson
The nicest you've seen in a while
Believe it, the people the reason I'm out
They showin' me love, and open me up
That’s why I see 'em and greet 'em with smiles
Shorty be lettin' me into her house
Pickin' her up, then dickin' her down
They passin' me weed, relaxin' with me
They heard that the kid was the chillest around
Somewhere in Pittsburgh, kickin' it back, watchin' the Steelers
Put your Reggie Bush away, we got some real herb
Shorty a weed ho, so nah, I don't feel her
'Cause I'm just on to the next, don't get your feelings hurt
 [Chorus]
Some days I be feelin' like I am the shit (I am the shit)
Wearin' clothes right out the package
Lookin' how nice they fit (How nice they fit)
And I swear I'ma be the fuckin' dopest
As long as I can stay up on my grind (Stay up on my grind)
I'ma always know where my home is (Home is)
I've got a Pittsburgh state of mind (State of mind)

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey
A different city every day, the same youngin' though
Hoes from the bungalows who wanna drop and touch they toes
Lookin' for some money, we ain't gonna give 'em nothin', no
It's big pimpin' over here , where the fuck you go?
I be foolin' around, chillin' and passin' the doobie around
Out on the road, 'bout to be blowed
Everyone know I'm a fountain with flow
Up at the Telly, I'm countin' my dough
Makin' this money ,you out with your ho
Gettin' a couple of thousand a show
So if you still don't, then act like you know
Never done heard of a rapper before
Rappin' so rapid they clappin' like, ""Oh!""
That man Mac on a roll, they jumpin' with joy, see 'em tappin' they toes
Told you that no one can spit it like I
Out gettin' money, you sittin' inside
Never are they ever sick of my rhyme
Need to be chiefin' this piff, gettin' high, woah
Ha, maybe I'ma slow it down
This shit blowin' your mind, I got the dopest sound
You better start rollin' up, the Most Dope around
I'm so high, high, not even close to down
 [Chorus]
Some days I be feelin' like I am the shit (I am the shit)
Wearin' clothes right out the package
Lookin' how nice they fit (How nice they fit)
And I swear I'ma be the fuckin' dopest
As long as I can stay up on my grind (Stay up on my grind)
I'ma always know where my home is (Home is)
I've got a Pittsburgh state of mind (State of mind)

If any of you are students of the pop music field, then you all know that the way to make a fortune is to come out with an entirely new sound. Of course, that isn't so easy to do. Half the time it happens by accident. For instance—"

Long journey to the top of the ski slope
I keep away from all these haters and these mean hoes
She rock a pea coat to cover up them cheap clothes
Never knew that they would bite her in the ass
Late start and I need to catch a flight, so hail a cab
If I miss my plane, Benjy gonna come and kick my ass
This and that, snapbacks from a fitted cap
Baggy clothes, ratty hoes gettin' rid of that
I'm so on point, you could play me out

You like to party? Well, I like to work
It's paper over pussy 'cause the money like to flirt
And I'm 'bout it, 'bout to hand the checks to my accountant
On my official shit, no, not on my whistle shit
Day job to me is like a book to those illiterate
I'm a kid, but you the one who throwin' hissy fits
You the one that never seem to feel me spittin'
Now I'm limited edition and you pussy like a clitoris
Most Dope syndicate, my people stand together
Through the rain, sleet, snow, any weather, it's whatever
I thought I told you that we won't stop
Got the crowd standin' up like they seat so hot
Got 'em like, ""Yo, Mac, when the beat gon' drop?""

But now it's feelin' like without ya
Feelin' like how the fuck did

I know I'm out of my mind more often than not
You know I'm used to givin' this all that I got, yeah
It's not a waste when that smile on your face
You tell me you outta place, you parked in my spot
Okay, baby, this a piece of cake
We could lay up on the beach, you could feed me grapes
This my favorite song, spin it ‘til the needle breaks
We could quit the whole game, do the real estate thing

Put in work, turn that pussy to the office
Be on top of your game, this here a goddess

Been rap game tighter than boa constrictors
Rollin' stone like a boulder ravin', I'm so impatient and goin' dumb
As disclosin' my fuckin' home location to total strangers
No love in my heart for coppers, blood from my lungs on the sink

You keep taking friends that I'll never see again
I guess they gotta leave
But if we pretend that they never left
Well, we gon' see them then
Never leave our heart, never leave our thoughts
As time goes by, they'll never be forgot
Life goes on, though I wish that they was there
Shit like this never gonna seem fair, yeah
So can I have a moment of silence
For anyone who's gone from the coldness of violence?
And I know you wanna see me go to college
But I'm sorry, I don't think that I'ma make it
Because this world is mine for the takin'
So when I get famous, they gon' know what your name is
And no one understand what the pain is
And how the blood run numb where my veins is
I'd like to thank you, 'cause you made me a man
Told me to never let it go, so I'm taking a stand
Always in the crowd when I played in the band
Your grandson is everything I say that I am
And maybe I am a little bit over my head
But I'm feeling so alone tryna cope with your death
Holding my breath, wishing I had one more day
Wishing you could be there when I graduate
Ugh, and it's sad to say
That no one in this room understand me
I know you had to leave, so rest in peace
But please, can you watch over Nanny?
'Cause she loved you, and I love you
All the prayers I'm saying may bug you
But I'm just checking in on what you up to
So, how they treating you up there?
Too stubborn for a cane, way too cool
Sleeping at your house, walking me to school
Thought I was a fool when my grades started slipping
When I played ball, you was always in admission
You loved me more than I've been loved before
And that's a type of thing that everyone ignores
But not me, you got me
Always and forever, Poppy

Time goes by, going without you
Hope you know I've been thinking about you
And I know, I know, I know, I know
That they took you from your home

This shit these rappers talkin 'bout, I'm gettin' bored of that

This, or that, and a wiffle ball bat
Make a million dollars, then I give it all back
These rappers talkin' shit when they shit is all wack (Ayy)

It's all live, baby (Baby)
Golded up like Tut, It make guys hate me (Uh)

How dare a man lift his hand at me like I'm gon' flinch?
I'm not no bitch (Uh-uh)
With the concreature concrete monuments (Monuments)

Nick Bruno, Boldy James kinda shit
It's like The Godfather, y'all gotta honor this (Honor this)
Tryna split the money up like communists (Okay)
You should shake the person hand that put you on to this
Hold up, this the swag you would kill for (Kill for)
What the fuck you tryna chill for? (Wake up)
Are you alive or a stillborn?
'Cause you really ain't livin' 'til you get yours
Sky's the limit, we could build doors
Open 'em up, nothin' gon' be closed, I'm sure

Ugh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I came through whippin' somethin' clean like a bald head
Bitch with me drop-dead gorgeous, plus she well read
I'ma get brain on the plane if it's overnight
I'ma maintain in the game, I ain't overnight
Colder than some polar ice, or like the ghost on Poltergeist
Opinions suck, I know I'm nice, money talks, you overpriced
I'm doper, fuck a sober life, you local, you ain't smokin' right
My weed loud as Hulk Hogan fights when he rip his shirt
On the throne, you kickin' dirt, sip this purp, and spit berserk
You a bitch, your chick a flirt, stop your cryin', get to work
I talk shit, got the stats that'll back it up
My shit addin' up, rackin' up a plaque a month
And that loud-ass bass you hearin', that's the trunk
That vibration on your body, now that's a bump
You can tell us who you are, you don't have to front
You ain't a captain, you just Captain Crunch

[Interlude: Sam Kinison]
Woo, I've done it, brother, I've done it
I've screamed at God at the top of my lungs, ‘cause that's how much I believe in him, amen
That's how personal I feel like my relationship is
If I can't be myself with The Father, then I'm gonna stop preachin' this Gos—
 [Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I rock A-P-C, some B-A-P-E
So many different clothin' brands, I got A.D.D.
Bought a big old crib, you can picture me in it
Just decided that the sky isn't really my limit
Somethin' cold in my cup, some weed, rollin' a blunt
Smile on like I convinced Oprah to fuck
I think I lost my mind, need a Amber Alert
You can't talk that shit unless you stand in it first
Turn a bitch to a fan, even hand her some merch
To be a legend, you gotta start out with that amateur work
And I paid my dues, walked humbly on an ego trip
Sleepin' with a freaky bitch, you was chillin', chiefin' fifth
Doin' drugs with a porno chick, watchin' porno flicks
Make our own movie and I'm scorin' it
I'll see you in hell before I see you winnin'
Did it myself, and I beat the system

[Interlude: Dennis Terry]
I believe it's a spiritual thing
If we'll put God back in America, we can have revival in America
And the Holy Spirit will show up, and great and mighty things will happen for this country

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I got thirty thousand grams in a black on black van (Why?)
Tell El Chapo I'm his number one fan (Damn)
I'm at Bent Taco with a hunnid A-bands
And you ain't gettin' no work listenin' to this money change hands
I'm tryna sow the whole block up, that's my plan (Plan)
We can have a gun fight like Iraq and Iran
Half a mil' on el tran
Sellin' [?] to make bands (Bands)
I'm movin' kushy, you's a bussy pussy, come between friends (Huh?)
If my Vo try to book me, I'ma get the front end
Style sixty niggas wit' me with a 100 FN's
Ice cubes on my wrist, bitch, I got a Mac-10
I put her out, she got her mom, right, I'll let her back in
It's Gucci"

Y'all dead wrong, I'm upper with the echelon

Been around, just like word of mouth, you gon' hear me out, and I

Puttin' a check in the box, straight to the top

Damn
Aight, uh

[Verse 1]
Smokin' on this purple got my mind all hazy
But it never put my grind on lazy
I just wanna get my shine on, baby
I know it drive you crazy that my grind's on daily
'Cause I be gettin' blowed every day of the week
This haze got me so cheifed that I stay in my seat
You wanna get me to spit, just play me a beat
I strive to win in everything 'cause i hate the defeat
So I elevate my mind (Mind)
Gotta stay cheifin'
And I don't even rap, boy, this just the haze speakin' (Haha)
My room bangs and it got the rays tweakin'
Smokin' blunts of haze, i just watch the day leavin'
With L's around the circle, you can tell that this some purple
'Cause this dank is so potent, If you smell it, it'll hurt you
I smoke that fruity with the funkiest fumes: Pepi Le Pew
Got a little skunk in the room, now chill
Lay back, meditate (Meditate)
I'm floatin', feelin' lighter than a featherweight (Featherweight)
My body asleep, but my head awake
I dedicate the rest of my night to makin' hella cake (Haha)
Pardon the lingo, it's prolly this Cali
The addiction and the plague got me wantin' it badly
I chase money like a hard to get female
Then throw it back up in the water like a seashell
 [Chorus: Sample & Mac Miller]
Sitting in the silent twilight
The purple half light of the twilight
Wrap the night around me (Hey, Jerm, where you find this weed at, man?)
Blanket of black on my back (Got the boy a blunt in here)
I feel safe in the darkness (Cheah, cheah)
(That purple, gotta love that purple)

I get blowed then melt into the chair
Blow a L up in the air, eyes is red, but I don't care (I don't care)
Right now I prolly shouldn't be spittin' (Nah)
'Cause I'm lifted and mixin' up my diction
I'm feelin' high like the top of a water tower
Cop a sour then it's gone in a hour
Heavily medicated, sedated and faded (Faded)
Relaxed, chasin' an oasis
I'm in a safe haven (Haven), free from any trouble
Stumble, damn, this kush got me seein' double (Damn)
Need not fumble
Gotta keep my head straight
'Cause I stay puttin' haters in the checkmate (Bitch)
Uh-huh, now I'm way past blowed
Purple weed got me feelin' on my own
Ain't nothin' like a purp high, the type to make a nerd high
It got me coughin' up a lung like it's my first time
Metaphors and similes from Ecuador to Italy
Back in fifth grade when I lost my weed virginity
Smokin' like a chimney, blowin' out a cloud
This purple, last kush stay stinkin' up my house
 [Chorus: Sample & Mac Miller]
Sitting in the silent twilight (Man, I love when she sing like this, right? Go 'head, girl)
The purple half light of the twilight (With that purple, get high)
Wrap the night around me

I feel safe in the darkness (So, y'all can ash your blunts now, roll up another)

Shootin' reckless at the father, almost murdered the kid
Or is it karma for the shit that both the parents had did?
Ain't embarrassed, where I'm livin' we get merit for kills

Voted heartless 'cause my momma made me part of the guild

Drag him down by the river, he'll be missin' for years
And them funerals was usual, ain't sheddin' no tears

I'll take a tax from your ass, go ahead and start swingin'
'Cause when it's my turn, your ears just won't be ringin' (Life)
See, I tear them shits off with these lyrics
Turn you into food to feed spirits, yup, I feed spirits
I know you fear it, but come close and listen
I'm speakin' so beautifully, these words get smitten (Smitten)
I got lyrics written (Written) on the walls and the ceilin' (Ceilin')
Every room in the crib, from my bathroom to kitchen (Kitchen)
This beat and words in the air through my bedroom
Cluttered space, I have but an inch of headroom
 [Chorus]
(Life) I'm your everyday blunt smokin', rap bumpin' imbecile (See, that's how it is, man)
Your everyday blunt smokin', rap bumpin' imbecile (The Ill Spoken)
Your everyday blunt smokin', rap bumpin' imbecile (Easy Mac, that's how we gon' do it)
Blazin' the haze and just playin' with some syllables
I'm your everyday blunt smokin', rap bumpin' imbecile (Don Notz)
Your everyday blunt smokin', rap bumpin' imbecile (Yo, let me get into this one more time real quick)
Your everyday blunt smokin', rap bumpin' imbecile (I ain't done with these muhfuckers yet)
Blazin' the haze and just playin' with some syllables (Life)

[Verse 2]
'Cause it's pen and a pad, letter to word, word to verses
My pen stays on the page like I'm writin' them in cursive (Yup)
Thoughts to mind, I brought to rhyme in jotted lines
See, I bought a dime to hold me over 'til the clock is nine (Life)
Lifted, reach out my hands to pull you in (Yup)
See, I take you back to class like the day that school begins
When I was ten, I decided this wasn't me
Started spliffin' up trees and got skimped with the weed (Life)
But I was ten, a playground punk try and start shit
Spark spliffs, throwin' enemies into a shark pit
Chronic seemed to be the way to make me happy
The fifth grader who passed tree up in the alley
See, me and Beedie, well, we been knew each other
When we was younger, I was chillin' with his lil' brother (Yo)
He knew me as the young buck hangin' with the older kids
That fifth grader who was posted up smokin' spliffs (Life)
I was never the kid who didn't speak his mind
Rulin' every school I went to, man, the streets was mine
For elementary, I went to East Hills
I was taught to let the beef grill, it was kill or be killed (True)
Then I ain't gon' lie, it's cool
I spent two or three years up at a private school
The lil' troublemaker, never did abide by rules
Baggy khakis, untucked shirt and untied shoes
 [Chorus]
(Life) I'm your everyday blunt smokin', rap bumpin' imbecile
Your everyday blunt smokin', rap bumpin' imbecile
Your everyday blunt smokin', rap bumpin' imbecile
Blazin' the haze and just playin' with some syllables (Life)
I'm your everyday blunt smokin', rap bumpin' imbecile
Your everyday blunt smokin', rap bumpin' imbecile
Your everyday blunt smokin', rap bumpin' imbecile
Blazin' the haze and just playin' with some syllables (Life)

[Outro]
Aight, y'all
See, that's how it is, how it's always gon' be
From age sixteen to whenever I feel like stop rappin', you know what I'm sayin'?
What up? It's The Ill Spoken
""What up?"" to my man Beedie
You know, right now we doin' it big, real big
Basically, to all my boys who been with me along the way
Talkin' 'bout $weet Jame$, D-Wreck, TriGGa (Life)"

[Verse 1]
Oh shit, here come the best part
Weapons from the Death Star
Puttin' metals through your Kevlar
Methods unorthodox
Due to the endorphins lost
I'm morphin' to some sort of corpse
Don't snort the devil's nectar
It's hard drugs and memoirs
Don't fuck with shit except ours
The rest is lightweight
For Christ's sake, I'm knockin' heads off
Depressed off the meds I acquired for my depressed pops
'Cause, I like the rush more
I'm Herman Blume— don't get crossed
Amongst the privileged pissin' on groups of little kids
Litterin', mobbin', ignorant, flickin' off all the fed cars
It's young Reptar, duelin' with the Templar
Where the wicked and the sins are
Gettin' head with the Benz parked
My repertoire of records broken, every single check large
Once you gettin' M's you start to question who your friends are
Yeah, from out the dark the million men march
Ready, set, start (Ready, set, start)

Okay, said
The music secular, I'm givin' bitches dental work
Let the homies get a turn, man, them hoes just never learn
Some meth to burn and a connect that's 'bout to get some sherm
Tryna get so faded I forget that I was ever born (Yeah)
You new rappers is all the lil' homies
I need a bitch that sip 40's and keep the pistol for me
I'm finna O.D., I know it, I need to slow down my dosage
The money hittin' my phone but I don't answer, I'm loaded
See, I give a bitch the stale face
Good dick and a band-aid
That ass got a address, I come early like a tailgate
Painkillers before the liquor at a snail's pace
I treat the world like it's jail bait (Fuck it)
Yeah
And I am not your enemy
But I bring the devil that's temptin' me
Do not fear your ignorance, the open mind is infinite
I escape this prison, fit in better where the sinners live
I'm dealin' with urges emergin' from dark places
I try to hide 'em though
Lies I hide behind keep remindin' me I'ma die alone
Higher than I can handle, my mind is scrambled, I'm tweakin'
What do I believe in? All my dreams turn into demons and they thirsty
It's seven thirty, try my best to hurry
Victims don't get the mercy, nuttier than Eddie Murphy
Tardy to the party, now it's common knowledge
I'm a fuckin' problem
Yeah
I chew this shit, God bless me
You will respect me
It's all good, I got the Based God to protect me
Been smokin' less weed, meet my new friend Speed
I'ma fuck the world up 'til they forget me"

Uh, think I can see a fuckin' halo (Halo), about to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano (Drano), some soda for the flavor
Uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbor with the bitches, he got special needs (Sheesh)
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe (Please)
They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored (Tailored), me and Action rappin'
Al be fuckin' with the fader (Fader), sippin' mind eraser
Actually, we rappin' for the fuck of it
Takin' money from you, gonna smack you out in public
You the Republican government
Abundance of substance, have a consumption to fuck a bitch (*Woman moans*)
With your Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick
And your bitch lookin' like Cousin Itt, the ugliest

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit (Woo)

Blow the dice, roll them shits, hit another trip (King Crack)

Hands are fuckin' hotter than the leather in the 6 in the summertime (Uh)

And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede Puma
My look is Jay Buhner, doggy, 'cause some of us just age sooner (I'm goin', man)

Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly motherfucker
Leather to the foot, horses, I led 'em to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money, but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no motherfuckin' fakin' that

This name says ""Crack dealin' trap nigga slash cap peeler
Back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers""
In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my mind's first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir, taps liquor
Then pass 'til it goes around the room, like his casket finna
Oh, you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
You-hoo! I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure that look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you beastie, boy
You can't match a killer with that, wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm
I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King
You're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were struckin' blows, bloody nose for your honey roll
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You a bully's best day ever, with them Nikes on your feet
Comin' through Blue Slide Park

On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump

I ain't worry 'bout poppin' tags, shoppin' bags
Cleaner than a laundromat
But regular enough that people walkin' past, him
No need to hide my face like a hockey mask

Spit with the flames, that's the trick of the trade
My words will stick to your brain while I sit in the grave
I kick it with grace, shit's got me sick of the grades
I'm pissed, in a rage, causin' me to rip out the page
It's a crisis, spittin' with literary devices
More disciples than Christ gets
My words will leave you lifeless, deep inside your mind like a physic
I might kick nice shit, never gon' write shit
Three thousand what they ice is, a hundred what they might get (I ain't got that kinda cash)
Spit like mine? Well, it's priceless
And ain't nobody wanna make the right move 'cause they might lose

From other kids inside this life to veterans of twenty-eight

Put your nose out of place, your bone will head up to your brain

Don't take my headphones, I hear the instrumental

I laugh at the fag, but what is his strategy?
It's blasphemy, burn and piss on you with acid pee
Only man who can beat me is me, like Cassidy
See, easy-speakin' majesty, cash like Nash for three
Ain't givin' up the rock, you can pass to me
And actually sad to see this is how it has to be
Tragedy, geography, you can study a map of me

And these are my biceps, where I gain my muscle

And everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit

Said, it's a
Dark science when your friends start dyin'
Like, how could he go? He was part-lion
Life goes on, your tears all dried in
A couple years are gone by by then
I said, can you please help me find my friend?
I'll give you anything you need, multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place where the time don't end
So you don't need money, all you got is time to spend
I'm sayin', your life short, don't ever question its length
And it's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength
Said, I recommend no limits, intricate thought
Go 'head, just give it a shot, you'll remember shit you've forgot

[Bridge: Mac Miller & Tay Walker]
'Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
So when the world's lookin' hopeless
I'ma still hold shit down

Hell yeah, it's Most Dope, bitch, just got it tatted on me

No time for bullshit and no bad advice

Always pay homage to the dudes who came before me
Hidin' from the top 'cause I heard that it was lonely
Never goin' back to the old me, so here's the new me

And now we got fans who wanna film him
To be honest, it's a little much to comprehend
'Cause everywhere I go, they know they gotta let me in
Stay humble though, mama raised a gentleman
Told me, ""Be polite when you introduced to Benjamin""
But now I'm spendin' them, actin' like the president
Try and shake the world like I'm jumpin' round some gelatin
And they think they Tempur-Pedic

This is shit they shoulda kept a secret
But fuck it, I'ma let you see it

But Damon Wayne's in livin' color with these shades of gray
Conversatin' with the treble, tryna raise the bass
I shake the place with the boomin' of an 808
Smokin' weed and havin' feast up at the Quaker Steak
It ain't a thang but a chicken wang, homie
I'm just cruisin' in the Civic, no Bimmer, Benz or Bentley
Boy, I talk it how I live it, and I rock it when I spit it
I'm so popular with misfits and dip shits who get they wigs split for bad business
Last Christmas, I had some shit up on my wish list
Increases in my digits got me coppin' it to give gifts
Big kids, silencin' the critics, all up in it
Now I'm fuckin' every single place my dick fit
The dawn of the dead, and if you know this song
Then sing along in your head before we on to the next
I keep that 2001 Chronic weed, it got me on my Mr. Cruise Scientology
The young prodigy, and it's been known, it's in my genealogy
Sauna heat, ain't a single motherfucker hot as me
My poppy seed got 'em all addicted to the thought of me
Hoes stay obsessed, always callin' me while girls be sendin' pictures
I get the finest lady and her sister
Boy, I heard you fucked McKenna Fisher
I heard your nasty ass even nutted when you kissed her
That's a bad decision, you can't blame it on the liquor
I get the finest bitch, dick her like my name was Richard
At the bowling alley, drinkin' liters out a pitcher
Boy, get your bummy ass back to the bullpen
Yeah, you was a kid too, but wasn't this cool, man

Everywhere you go, the people always drop his name
From the north to the south, east to the west

Like, ""You look beautiful, can I get some coochie though?""
Girl, I get you free into the show
But in Star, we expectin' you to blow, woah
Now, I ain't talkin' 'bout every single lady
Just them hoes who be actin' all crazy
Sorry, you a ho, not a female
If I got some naked pictures in my email
And I never even met you, you just like my songs
I'm reachin' for the condom, you say you don't want one on
Bra, pause, sorry 'bout that bitch talk
Let me get it back up on my hip-hop, haters, you can kick rocks
I'm this hot, they substitute me for a fryin' pan

Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya, yeah
We was in the attic, you could smell the weed
Bitches gettin' naked, we was sellin' E, argh
Bitches kissin' bitches just like Ellen D (Ellen D)
In the kitchen whippin' biscuits, givin' generously (Thank you)
I thank the Lord I made it out, no STD (Word)
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs

Yeah, they tell me, ""Get yourself straight (Straight)

I'm just tryna grow up old and rich (Old and rich)
Maybe get married to a local bitch (A local bitch)
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit (Over shit)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness (No way, no way, no way, no way, no way)
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich (Old and rich)

I be, I be, I be, I be over shit (Over shit)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness (Okay)

Ladies and gentlemen in attendance, good mornin'
It's the Babyface Don Dada checkin' in
And I want you to know
It ain't about complainin', it's about maintainin'

Don't ever become content
Because you will repent
Ya feel that? Go get it
That's your life, go live it
Pass me my Hennessy and my Grand Marnier

[Verse]
American born, welcome to my stompin' grounds (What's good?)
In Point Breeze, where I used to walk around my father's house (Oh)
Older brother used to always say I was adopted
Convinced I'm a Russian foster child my family forgot about (Damn)
Curious toddler, such imagination (Imagination)
Didn't have the patience to be top of the class at my graduation (Fuck that shit)
Little pervert infatuated with masturbation
Couldn't wait to bust a nut, watchin' porn, in love with sluts (Titties)
Rusty trumpets and such, disgusting sleazy shit
Twelve-year-old sexual deviant, got my penis licked
In seventh grade (Uh-huh), thought I was a man now (Uh-huh)
Couldn't understand how my parents still thought I was a little kid (Okay)
I had the mind of a hundred-nine-year-old elder man
The passion of the Christ and the memory of an elephant (Woah)
Used to wonder all 'bout Heaven and Hell
Witnessed death at a young age, I said to myself
""We all mortals"" (Woah), we leave this world into eternal life
Other kids of different religions wonder which person's right (You never know)
Worry 'bout your fate, no separation of church and state
You'll be good, never break the law, you'll see the pearly gates (Huaaah)
Fuck philosophical, back to the diabolical
Binoculars couldn't see my skills, I'm way too ill for that (I'm way too ill for that)
I feel my raps will be underrated and under-appreciated
Until I (*Click-clack*) pow, blow my brains out (*Gunshot*; pow)
I need to stop payin' attention to opinion shit
I rather be the pen that come and sign your death certificate (Certificate)
Kill your career if you just give me a year (Yep)
The X Factor, whip my dick out, give Britney the spear (Haha)
Got some shit for your ears, it's somethin' to be excited 'bout
Here to give you industry critics some shit to write about (Yeah)
Me or you, who got the nicer house? (Hmm)
You got a daughter of age? Might have to pipe her now (Uh)
If Sean Price is Mike Tyson now (Bitch)
I might as well turn my life around and check these fools like Nike town (Yep)
What would have happened if Lance had never biked a mile?
I was blind, but I'm seein' like a psychic now (Uh-huh)
I know the future like Atlanta ('Lanta)
I knock it out the park like my name was Joey Randa (Pow)
Ball like (What?) Miguel Cabrera (Okay) or Garciaparra (Okay)
Sail the French Riviera and my camera panorama (Woo)
This radiation, sample the gamma (Gamma)
I look like money, Willy Whips looks like a panda, word (Tahaha)
Sinister, administer bits of comic life
You bullshittin', homie, go and get your economics right (Money)
 [Chorus]
How many MCs wanna come and test me?
My technique weaving through this traffic on my jet ski (Don't be mad, I'm way better)
Looks can be deceiving and my raps are so friendly (Ah, they're so nice)
Oh, yes, my raps are so friendly (So polite)
How many MCs who wanna come and test me?
My technique weaving through this traffic on a jet ski (Hey, you suck my dick)
I know that looks can be deceiving and my raps are so friendly (Very nice)
So, you MCs, commend me (Please, tell me I'm good, makes me feel better)

Whit'cha little make-pretend steez (Yeah, you ain't real)
You bend knees and then deez nuts are in your mouth, bitch (Oh shit)
Fuckin' on your couch, bitch (Oh shit)
Bustin' on your mother's comber button blouse, bitch (Woo, damn)
Tryna get rid of me? This ain't Auschwitz (Woah, woah, woah, that's—that's a little...)
I pound bitches in their ass 'til I got brown dick (Ooh, ass-fuckin', ass-fuckin')
You're surrounded (Oh, you surrounded)

Ruined, I'm out this (Do you?)

Yeah, welcome to the dark side of my bizarre mind
I'm trapped inside of this amusement park ride
There's an atom bomb inside my hard drive
I'm holdin' the apocalypse (Apocalypse)
Let's take a ride and get lost in this metropolis (Metropolis)
Just realized that I'm an idiot
Wearin' my disguise, my real face is fuckin' hideous
My pretty bitch watchin' Insidious with her pussy out (Pussy out)
Aw, sookie-sookie now (Sookie-sookie now)
Rapper terrorist, rarer than good parents is
Puttin' hard drugs inside of all your baby's carriages
Arrogance, throwin' cherry bombs where the sheriff lives (Sheriff lives)
Just because that shit's hilarious (Shit's hilarious)
And I inherited the thirst for self-destruction and I'm scared of it
I wanna be buried with a novel and a chariot (And a chariot)
I'm a bigger illusion than good marriages (Marriages)
Or what it means to be American

Out in Wichita, Kansas, smokin' meth with all the locals (All the locals)
Askin' them to teach me how to yodel
Suppose I'll die alone from an overdose of some sort
In a motel while some whore I’m fuckin’ runnin' to the drug store
I hacked into the motherboard, argued on a public forum
Uploaded a virus to the network, then unplugged the cord (Unplugged the cord)
The laws are not important
If you scared, lock your door then (Door then)
Okay, uh, I always feel like a foreigner
Morphin' into some sort of sorcerer (Sorcerer)
I'm Yuri's brother if it's Lord of War
What would I be normal for?
I'm goin' door-to-door shootin' pornos with a good script (Good script)

[Verse 1]
I'm just high, why they hatin' on me?
People tend to think all the drinks on me
I don't even have the money to spend
To buy Patrón for you and all your friends (Hey)
Baby, I be on my grind, rain, sleet, snow
Rollin' up good every place we go
'Cause we tryin' get high (Get high), get high (Get high), get high
Know the bullshit and all the problems, but we too gone to see
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
We proceed to give 'em what they need
Just wakin' up, then gettin' stoned
Rub my eyes and check my phone
Open up the fridge to make some waffles
But no more syrup left in my bottle, damn
Well, it's okay
I top it off with scrambled eggs, ayy
Gotta work with what you got, ayy (What?)
Gotta work with what you got

Supposed to be in class, but I ain't goin'
Let's chill on the couch
See what's on the telly
Girl, we won't leave the house
Can you stay a while?
Can you stay a while?
'Cause, girl, I'm feelin' lazy
And I'm tryna hang around
 [Verse 2]
Ain't tryna get out of my bed 'til noon
Neighbors smell the perfume, smoke in my room
And I got the door closed, can't be sure, though
Amsterdam weed, spendin' euros
Get the herb rolled, let's relax
Take your shoes off and kick it back
We escape the world, escape the stress
But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess
'Cause we gon' handle that later, we gon' handle that later
Right now, let's get this paper and smile for all them haters
Ayy, cream cheese and a bagel
Have a glass of milk and an Eggo
I'm rockin' PJs and no shirt
I smoke weed, eat yogurt
Enjoy the best things in your life
'Cause you ain't gonna get to live it twice (Twice)
They say you waste time asleep, but I'm just tryin' to dream

[Chorus]
Supposed to be in class, but I ain't goin'
Let's chill on the couch
See what's on the telly
Girl, we won't leave the house
Can you stay a while?

Hardcore pound fucking, that's the shit right there

I'm always up for a bargain
The dragons are flying south for the winter
They don't like cold weather either

Okay, I was drivin' up to Shangri-La to get my meditation on
I was thinkin' Lamb of God, she was thinkin' Saint Laurent
She sell the pussy on Millionaire's Avenue
Paper's not the problem, spendin' money always casual
Why do you whine like your last name was Rothschild?
Life been a bitch ever since they let me out the doghouse
No mercy for the docile, flow is hostile but don't sleep
The codeine came back to get me high again

Yeah, I am getting ready to sign my life away (My life away)
The weather's nice today, what a perfect day to die (Day to die)
She'd kill herself, but she'd rather get married
There's coconut vodka, but she'd rather have cherry (Have cherry)
I wish my drug dealer took the Amex (The Amex)
Can't find my debit card
I told her, ""Meet me by the Annex"" (The Annex)
We can get high by the reservoir (Reservoir)
Oh my goodness, girl, you a milkshake, extra large (Extra large)
No, you shouldn't, you said it'd never get this far (Get this far)
Do you have an extra ticket to the seminar?
Show me where all the old records are
She got a brand new dinette set, but she still don't know how to set the table
I told her that this feelin' 'bout as good as it gets
Shit, that bitch so unstable

Eyes have opened up like Folgers caps

Ain't sober much, I'm stoned as fuck
Smokin' drugs so blunted, the flow cold-blooded
But I know what it's like, broke, no money
No hundreds, no twenties, low budget, so hungry
You don't wanna be a nobody
Okay, most of the time, my head is close to the line
Of blowin' up, like shakin' up soda
Fall into a coma on the sofa
Rise from the sun, throw up and roll okra
Yessir, when the goin' get tough, guess what?
You fold up like yoga, well, you know, uh

Work on the road, you drove a Toyota Corolla
And you stay below the, speed limit, yeah

Tryin' to get quicker with decisions
Why do I need to get lifted?
I'm too unstable, keep your distance, yeah

Well, I was ridin' in shotgun, speedin' down the highway
Listenin' to music, haven't slept in like five days
I try take a nap, lean my head against the window
It feels real, I swear to God this shit pretend though
'Cause, me, I get high, make music for a livin'
If that ain’t the best job, then give me your opinion
'Cause I love life, chillin' for the night, case of Bud Light
Small world for me, but you, you live a Bug's Life
Scared to chase your dreams, scared to take a risk
Think it's make believe, so you hate the shit
Valentine, love it, grimier than rubbish
You softer than a Snuggie and you sweeter than a Sunkist
Never eatin' beets, on your Doug shit
Come with all the swagger, but you lackin' all the substance
Cool, the dude you used to wanna be in school
Spendin' money, drinkin' liquor, naked girls up in my pool

Ayo, my herb smoke tastin' like a Nerds rope
I'ma get rich so I can buy my bitch a fur coat
Somethin' like a millionaire in trainin'
Still my shit amazin', we jumpin' over puddles when it's rainin'
Plannin' on a tan, I'm in the sand
And we'll be jammin', make it bounce
While we dancin' on the clouds until I'm landin' in my house
Remember when my moms would hate me standin' on the couch
But now I'm makin' so much money, I start to lose count
I try and spend it quick, I got bills though
Yeah, I'm only eighteen, I got skills though
Beats, Rhymes, Life, Tribe Called Chill Flow
You been rappin' twenty-five years and you still broke
No disrespect, the riches is the art
I'm just mad at all these haters who was bitches from the start
We just do this 'cause we love it and it's settin' us apart
We was already gone while you was only on your mark, hey

Money come as fast as the mass assassin killers when we bill ya

Snatch up your plate and leave the rest for all y'all

My tongue twistin' is ticklin' just a little bit
I'm swimmin' inside of your skin like a river in the Caribbean

[Bridge]
It's okay that you like it, babe (I like it, babe), yeah (Uh-huh)
And it's alright that you misbehave
It's okay to be this way (This way)
You liberated, baby (Ooh, baby)
You chillin' with the AC

(Ah, the way we are) That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks, here we are

I open up your legs and go straight for your heart
The way we are
The way we are
 [Verse 2]
Said I'm too divine, I'm too divine, yeah, too divine
Who am I? Well, I'm Mr. Superfly
I'm Mr. Ooh-He-Blew-Your-Mind, hot as June, July
I wanna make your waterfall
Girl, you my paintin', you my art installation
Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall
All I wanna do is show you off, I want to put you on
Why would I ever blow you off? Right now, let's go get lost
Jet, I've been way too high for way too long, I'm so exhausted
Whether that's your mind or line, we still get crossed (Off)
First your name is gone, never understand until you have to stand alone
Can I have a hand to hold? A Band-Aid for my damaged soul
I paint the planet gold, swear I'm Michelangelo
I don't understand these hoes
They didn't want a man when it was, ""Man, I'm broke""
And now they on me, and they're what I don't need
They gon' see it's gon' be what it's gon' be

[Chorus]
(Ah, the way we are) That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks, here we are

Ugh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I came through whippin' somethin' clean like a bald head
Bitch with me drop-dead gorgeous, plus she well read
I'ma get brain on the plane if it's overnight
I'ma maintain in the game, I ain't overnight
Colder than some polar ice, or like the ghost on Poltergeist
Opinions suck, I know I'm nice, money talks, you overpriced
I'm doper, fuck a sober life, you local, you ain't smokin' right
My weed loud as Hulk Hogan fights when he rip his shirt
On the throne, you kickin' dirt, sip this purp, and spit berserk
You a bitch, your chick a flirt, stop your cryin', get to work
I talk shit, got the stats that'll back it up
My shit addin' up, rackin' up a plaque a month
And that loud-ass bass you hearin', that's the trunk
That vibration on your body, now that's a bump
You can tell us who you are, you don't have to front
You ain't a captain, you just Captain Crunch

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I came through stuntin', you came in buggin'
I came in real, you came through frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doin' nothin' (Nothin')
All that money don't make you nothin'
I came through stuntin', you came in buggin'
I came through real, and you came in frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doin' nothin' (Nothin')
And all that money don't make you nothin'
 [Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I rock A-P-C, some B-A-P-E
So many different clothin' brands, I got A.D.D.
Bought a big old crib, you can picture me in it
Just decided that the sky isn't really my limit
Somethin' cold in my cup, some weed, rollin' a blunt
Smile on like I convinced Oprah to fuck
I think I lost my mind, need a Amber Alert
You can't talk that shit unless you stand in it first
Turn a bitch to a fan, even hand her some merch
To be a legend, you gotta start out with that amateur work
And I paid my dues, walked humbly on an ego trip
Sleepin' with a freaky bitch, you was chillin', chiefin' fifth
Doin' drugs with a porno chick, watchin' porno flicks
Make our own movie and I'm scorin' it
I'll see you in hell before I see you winnin'
Did it myself, and I beat the system

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I came through stuntin', you came in buggin'
I came in real, you came through frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doin' nothin' (Nothin')
All that money don't make you nothin'
I came through stuntin', you came in buggin'
I came through real, and you came in frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doin' nothin' (Nothin')
And all that money don't make you nothin'
 [Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I got thirty thousand grams in a black on black van (Why?)
Tell El Chapo I'm his number one fan (Damn)
I'm at Bent Taco with a hunnid A-bands
And you ain't gettin' no work listenin' to this money change hands
I'm tryna sow the whole block up, that's my plan (Plan)
We can have a gun fight like Iraq and Iran
Half a mil' on el tran
Sellin' [?] to make bands (Bands)
I'm movin' kushy, you's a bussy pussy, come between friends (Huh?)
If my Vo try to book me, I'ma get the front end
Style sixty niggas wit' me with a 100 FN's
Ice cubes on my wrist, bitch, I got a Mac-10
I put her out, she got her mom, right, I'll let her back in
It's Gucci

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I came through stuntin', you came in buggin'
I came in real, you came through frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doin' nothin' (Nothin')
All that money don't make you nothin'
I came through stuntin', you came in buggin'
I came through real, and you came in frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doin' nothin' (Nothin')
And all that money don't make you nothin'
 [Outro: Gucci Mane]
Its Gucci, what's happenin'?
Smoke somethin', pour up
Get you some money

Why you always at the mall when you're broke? Yeah

Maybe dunk, but I never been tall, yeah

God knows I came close (Don't try this at home)
I know I probably need to do better

You never told me bein' rich was so lonely

They know that I so need my space
Don't wanna grow old so I smoke just in case
She say that I glow below the waist
And the stroke is just so PGA
All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drawin' shapes and lines of a world we made
Tomorrow may be right around the corner
But I swear it's gon' be worth it if I make you wait
There's somewhere above you, keep reachin' up

Yeah, nine times out of ten, I get it wrong
That's why I wrote this song, tell myself to hold on
I can feel my fingers slippin', in a motherfuckin' instant, I'll be gone
Do you want it all if it's all mediocre?
Starin' at the wall and the wall full of posters
Lookin' at my dreams, who I wanna be?
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Ooh, I been a fool but it's cool, that's what human beings do
Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes
Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun comin' out now, clouds start to move

Tell them haters, call your army, bring your tanks

Self-employed, independent, once you start, don't take no breaks
Work until I get it, I bet it's gon' take a second
But once I start up my engine, I'm gone, too fast to catch him
I'm Lennon mixed up with UGK, maybe try that purple drink
What I'm on is strong, yours weaker than seven days
You sweeter than crème brûlée, presidential head of state
Dopest mothafucka since before I hit the seventh grade
Elevate, Buddha shit, cooler than what coolest is
Slick without no lubricant, bullshit, you just full of it
Stupid bitch, keep on hatin', I'ma keep on doin' it

Most Dope is my family, have respect for my conglomerate
Rollie on my wrist, I ain't rich, but I'm still coppin' shit
Jerm is on the beat, he got that heat, hold up, drop it quick
And bring it back
I could change the world with just a single track
Underage table in the back, smokin', drinkin' yak
Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at
On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'ma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball
After all, only get one life, so there's no time to stall
I'ma do it, stupid dudes with all exclusive shit to move with
Just a few kids tryna bullshit, still my boys I straight up grew with

Let the smoke signal guide you back home like Indians
And lend a spliff, and bullshit with my kinsmen
The Yuengling coolin' me down from the heat on the streets (Yeah)
Take me back to those times of peace
Let me see those leaves turn at Frick, and kick flows that's sick
And think back to chicks who loved my magic stick

[Verse 1: John Record & EZ Mac]
When you look back, Malcolm (What's good?)
Never forget, never regret the outcome
Never tear or spend a year askin', ""How come?""
Lookin' for love, 'cause you found some
Never let a dime infiltrate your mind
She has no right questionin' McCormick design
Never quest for beef, always be cordial in rhymes
Never bored with your time on this planet Earth
Take a nap, take a snap, but when you take it for granted, it hurts
Try to be thrifty, so you manage your worth
Expect the best but plan for the worst
Never take advice from those who never question themselves
But your mental health should never be menaced by doubt
MM, I'm your MC mentor
There for sure when things go south
I'm out, en route to beat back the nookie (Ha)
She says she loves me, what she want, half a cookie?
Never contemplate life when you're higher than giraffe pussy

Met Rec', the rest is history (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause him and me, well, we hit the weed in-between the misery
We spit for free, we had dreams of gettin' cream
But things don't always go exactly how they seem
The big kids, they talkin' 'bout they big guns
But I just chill, lay back, hear the kick drum
Boom kak, boom-ba-boom kak
Around and back, now I'm gettin' off track
And I saw rap as a way to get away
From everybody tellin' me today is not my day
My day, my week, my month, my year my tears
Held back, confronted by my fears
This endless intelligence, my mind can expand
As high as I am, chill, I'll be fine with a gram (Ha)
'Cause I'll be bumpin' through the speaker box, tryna bust a flow
At first an outcast lookin' for the love below
But don't mistake my terminology for philosophy
Screamin' 'til I get what I want like a toddler be
Urban mythology, the words of the prophecy
The prodigy, see deep inside your mind like psychology
Taught to be verbal, passin' purple in the circle like we pass a word
Savor the mind but you asked to serve
Attack the words, rip half as fast and your ass'll swerve
Got a question, ask it first
Pass the purp' and mash the verse

I be jumpin' off the bridge, but I'ma hit the ground runnin'
When the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)

Oh, weak, I'm feelin' weaker, my body, my soul (Ah)
Where's the fun in life? I got everything I want, I'm still broke (Ah)
I'll go on with the day, I'm movin' on forward (Ooh, ah)
So familiar with this way, I don't wanna feel no more
Feel enough

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Khalid]
Yeah, well, here I go again
Lizard cold skin and bones, hello, old friend
Heavy soul, head full of everything except control
I've become numb, try to touch it
Do I feel enough?
I could wait 'til the weight that I feel is lighter
Get away from the shade, the sun a little brighter
I could pray, but it's way too late
God don't wanna talk to me no more (No more; no)
We don't speak the same language, yeah
Please go away, I just wanna be by myself, and I don't need to explain shit
I been the shit, crib is big, whip is clean
I flip a switch, and get it lit instantly
Limitless, this is infinity
Bitter sweet symphony, I see this shit differently

[Chorus: Khalid]
Oh, weak, I'm feelin' weaker, my body, my soul (Ah)
Where's the fun in life? I got everything I want, I'm still broke (Ah)

So familiar with this way (Ah), I don't wanna feel no more
Feel enough

Can I feel e—? Do you feel e—
Feel enough?
Can I feel e—? Do you feel e—? Well (Feel e—)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & Khalid]
Yeah, can I live please? Can I breathe?
Will you give me a minute, so I can sit with me?
There's a limit I'm feelin', I'm walkin' with a leash
Wonder am I even free, if it's in a dream
It don't really make a difference
Lookin' at the city through a window from a distance
All I see is people gettin' busy livin'
The world spinnin' out of control, and I'm gonna miss it
Legs weak, runnin' on empty
I know how it go
First, she fall in love, when she finally had enough, she'll be gone
But won't leave without my soul
Then I'd be alone again, sayin', ""Where did everything go?""
Shit, I drove this road before, know where it goes
I don't wanna feel enough

[Chorus: Khalid]
Oh, weak, I'm feelin' weaker, my body, my soul
Where's the fun in life? I got everything I want, I'm still broke

I'm in love with this mic

I'm just a child, y'all gon' see me grow
But now I know, I've got so far to go

Uh
Sometimes I think about this time next year
Grindin' to the fullest, kickin' rhymes for your ears
I wonder if they hear me now, comin' fresh with a style
The illest child, always chillin' with a smile
'Cause hip-hop waitin' for me back at home
We just need to have a little time alone
'Cause lately I've been livin' life by my phone
Tryna do business, mind on my dough
Woah, hold up, let me take a rest
Bring it back with my dogs like I'm playin' fetch
I'm tryna be the future, moldin' the CD
Somethin' bumpin' out the system on repeat
My mind's elevated like E.T
Work hard in quick sand, knee deep
You know I'm always doin' double like a re-read
It's like I play the whole game with a cheat sheet
Dollar signs to my name like Too Short
Gonna go broke with this taxin' on Newports
I'm unhealthy, workin' to succeed
Tryna spit out more words than I can read
Stayin' up late, keep burnin' through this weed
My grandma probably turnin' in her G-R-A-V-E, grave, that's right
Spellin' bee champ, fifth grade
This my job, I'm about my guap
Keep it fresh like shoes right out the box
I'm just tryna give you somethin' loud that knocks
So far to go, but I'm never gon' stop

But I live free in a world that's make-believe (Uh-huh)

Off a L about a couple hundred feet long
Cop it by the pound, smoke until the weed gone (Yep)

Light up 'til the pain gone (Gone), all I hear is the same song (Song)
When the radio came on, fuck around and get based on (Bitch)
Do this shit 'til the day I die (Die), are you ready (Ready), are you ready? (No)
Terrified but my hand is steady (Steady), verified, get the camera ready (Click)
Carry my own weight, all these earthquakes don't wake
Me up from this deep sleep (Sleep), divin' into this cold lake (Brr)
Fuck a bitch 'til her toes shake (Shake), tellin' me I'm her soulmate (Mate)
Disguised emotion, no face, bullshit with that, no thanks (Uh-huh)
Dealin' with it since '08 (No), fucked around, now I'm done
And I heard you're supposed to race when you hear the sound of that gun (Blaow)
Now it's losin' all of its fun (Fun), spendin' days in solitude
Too many dumb interviews put me in this awful mood
Not thinkin' logical (No), gettin' high, jump off the moon (Moon)
Looked into his soul, when he died right there in the hospital
Peace don't seem possible (No), when the mind is so closed (Closed)

Wake me up from this bad dream (Dream), put a match to this gasoline ('Line)

Fucked up, can't feel myself, work hard, might kill myself
Exist through audio, but all my problems as real as hell
Trapped in this wishin' well, death creepin' like Splinter Cell
Gettin' high, blew my mind away, find the words, what I'm tryna say
I'ma think of that later (Later)
When the world goes against you, you better get that paper (Paper)

Nausea with some pretty little blonde dykes
Tried to keep my hands clean and my socks white

But in a bar fight, I hit ’em with the hard right
I roll the dice, play my cards right
Ain't a movie star, but I'm sparrin' with the Dark Knight

Higher than a Mars flight when this cigar light up like the star bright

Oh, you special, anybody ever told you? (Told you)
Ooh, you so special, has anybody ever told you? (Told you)
Do they know you so special? (I know what she want, I know what she like)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Well, I was born with a bored mind, chip on my shoulder
A sword and a war cry, I’ve been a soldier
Fight the horns for the Lord’s side
Before five I was fresh out the store fly, with a bitch courtside
Tint the windows by the doors, let the four ride
Speakers knockin', they can hear me in the north side
And I keeps the liquor pourin’ 'til the storm dry
The haters said I wouldn't make it 'til the pork fly
These days, got a lot of dick to swallow
They rather me hit the follow than hit the lotto
It’s like my trip on auto-pilot, 'til tomorrow I been chillin'
You way behind the wave, you at the shoreline
I'm Walter if it's Disney, Arnie Palmer when I hit green
The ganja in the '60s, I'm Obama if it's this week
The God inside my city, the monster in your kid's dream
Bottle of the whiskey got my head feelin' like, shit
The first dollar in your piggy bank
I'ma drink away until my liver break
Yeah, one in a million like findin' love on a Tinder date
Livin' great, swear I'm Justin Timberlake
Sharp as scissor blades or winter skates
I been in the kitchen like Minute Maid
And these bitches on my dick parades
But I leave 'em quicker than a lizard's legs
Oh well, they love me like I'm Nick Lachey
Triple play, in your face, fuck 'em all, give 'em AIDS
I eliminate then go away on Christmas break
I ain't dealin' wit' your shit today
You're gettin' finished like a dinner plate
Or a Philly steak
 [Chorus]
Oh, you special, anybody ever told you? (Told you)
Ooh, you so special, has anybody ever told you? (Told you)
Do they know you so special? (I know what she want, I know what she like)
You so special (I know what she want, I know what she like)
You so special (I know what she want, I know what she like)
You so special (I know what she want, I know what she like)
Yeah (I know what she want, I know what she like)
I know what she want, I know what she like

[Verse 1]
Let, let, let, let, let's get started
Nobody wanna be themselves, everyone's an artist
Walk around with a target on my head, take your best shot
Watch me do my thing, try and shoot me from the press box
We keep on goin' 'til they press stop
Errr-Errr, I'm breakin' records, so rewind
I left you scared, say a prayer, put it on the Holy Bible
Better hold a microphone like how a soldier hold a rifle
It's the Young Mac, I been there and done that
Went away, then come back with a motherfuckin' vengeance
I'm collectin', every sentence is impressive, learnin' lessons from the legends
Dreams is nightmares, so I fall asleep holdin' a weapon
Some people do this for attention
You can miss me with the bullshit, I gets busy with this music
Tell 'em, ""Shut up,"" or ""Get butt-fucked with a broomstick""
Been tourin' since before you were born, and I made the rules, bitch
Thou shalt not hold thy tongue
Don't quit, no goin' home until you done
Like train tracks or breakin' glass, you can hear me comin'
Motherfuckers better take off runnin'
 [Chorus]
Yeah
Danger, danger, this another banger
Feelin' like they know me, little homie, I'm a stranger
Moved out to the boonies, now I never deal with neighbors
No breaks, Speed Racer
I'm a Speed Racer (Pick up the pipe! Pick up the pipe!)
I'm a Speed Racer (Pick up the pipe! Pick up the pipe!)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Well, it's a speed racer, cross-over knee breaker
Green maker, creator, hotter than the lines on the equator
Take your life and remake ya, all for the green paper
Write it all down but never got the time for eraser
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' song though
Drummin' on some big ol' titties, I'm playin' bongos
I put my long pole in the wrong hole
She say, ""Get up out my stomach,"" I'm like, ""Bitch, you know you love it""
I'm disgustin', mind start to wonder about this world we in
Then it's back on the phone, I'm fightin' with my girl again
Shit... I never been normal, as a youngin'
I was in black clothes, they close the portal on me
Talkin' shit but you foldin' more than origami
I'm fuckin' awesome, better run along and call your mommy
'Cause we droppin' bombs more than atom do
Still we posted up on Penn Avenue
 [Chorus]
Yeah
Danger, danger, this another banger
Feelin' like they know me, little homie, I'm a stranger
Moved out to the boonies, now I never deal with neighbors
No breaks, Speed Racer

Roll hash till I'm passed, to the homies hoorah its the Utah jazz
So incredible alien with the tentacle cheifin' like he a Seminole people gather in festivals
They on my testicles tell the bitch slow down, we in the south bring your girls have a Ho Down
King fuck a gold crown mines is thorns, do drugs till I feel it in my spinal cord
Out in Germany more specific is Berlin
Merlin in love with the nature so bring the ferns in
Now we burnin' love to get high
That's for certain on drugs till he die
Its that simple go mental on instrumentals I tell her open her mouth I'm checkin' up on her dental

'Cause it get heavy in my mind sometimes, I don't want to carry anybody else
All I know is I'm okay, when the temperature rise I'll be cool

The unfortunate tale of Charlotte the Harlot

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Said there’s a rain cloud, outside the window where the main house
Our family sit silent at the table eating take out
Me and my step-sister just made out, the other night while everyone was hanging at the lake house
I realized that I loved her last summer, she appeared in my dreams naked, made me start to wonder if it was wrong
So we never got along, used to ignore each other
Argue and argue until our parents had to come in, they run in
Yelling and pulling belts out
My temporary tattoos, covered by a welt
How I wish that she would see I’m the one for her
And her polka dot dress reading Tom Sawyer
Yeah, they kept us in the house after school
No friends allowed over, staying hidden in our rooms
‘Cause inside was safe, and outside a dangerous place
She smiled at me, she was making we wait
In my thoughts, I undressed her, protect her
She come apart in front of me, I’d put her back together

[Chorus]
Yeah, I get kinda crazy when I miss her
Can’t tell nobody, but I’m in love with my step sister
Think I’m in love with my step sister, shit
Charlotte the Harlot
 [Verse 2]
Yeah, now we sneaking into the guest house
Tell our mom and dad that we went out
It’s storming outside, we’ll be gone ‘til it’s morning outside
We’ll never feel normal again
And I never been kissed before, I hope that she can teach me
Devoured by the power whenever she lay beneath me
She make it look so easy
She can turn my frown to a smile
Turn me to a man from a child
‘Cause I’m so lonely, and she’s so lovely
I’m obsessed, so can she touch me
Is it crazy, if I call her baby?
Will everybody hate me if they find out?
Yeah, see I fell for the sheltered angel, I can’t tell her
Charlottes’ Web a little bit tangled, can I help her

[Chorus]
It’s crazy when I miss her
Don’t tell nobody, but I’m in love with my step sister
Think I fell for my sister
Charlotte the Harlot

[Outro]
Said, it’ll be our little secret, it’ll be our little secret, babe
It’ll be our little secret, can it be our little secret, babe?
Said, it’ll be our little secret, it’ll be our little secret, babe
It’ll be our little secret, our little secret"

She breaks down the pain, she rolls up the weed
She far from a saint, she's all that I need
She lost in her thoughts, so hardly she speaks
Her mind's always dirty and her soul's never free (Woah-woah)
She never been a groupie (No way)
She just in love with the music
She watch depressin' movies (Always)
Somethin' from the '30s or the '40s about a dependent house wife (Woah-woah)
She makes up her bed like she makes up her stories
Awake through the night, then she high from the morning
I wish she could feel me, she never felt nothin'
Knock on her door, she let me come in (Woah)

I wish she would learn to laugh
Isolation, she lockin' the bathroom door

Baby, let's get stoned
Put on a record, can I play you one more song?
We can get stoned
I swear to God, Heaven feels just like home
Let's go home (Yeah)
 [Verse 2]
And the water, it's shallow like the lies that she tells
Can't run from your shadow, can't hide from yourself
She hates that she cries when she's all by herself
And she's always all by herself (Woah-woah)
She hardly talks in conversation (No way)
But, but when she do, all her words get lost in translation (Always)
No, she can't move (Woah-woah-woah)
'Cause she paralyzed from fear that she fantasize
The doctor tried to analyze
They cannot find anything that's wrong with her
Her parents never got along with her
I had to make this song for her (Woah-woah-woah)

I wish she would learn to laugh
Isolation, she lockin' the bathroom door

Baby, let's get stoned

How the fuck I'm supposed to have the time for anybody else?
No way, no way, stay alone in my domain

Tell 'em I'm okay, but really I know they hopin' I'm over my old ways

Yo, this one goes out to my boy [?]
On that hip-hop shit
Let's do it, Rec

[Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
Listen, what's the matter when you know it all?
(What's the matter with ya?)
You wanna pull a Shawshank freedom from your brain's wall
So you tell a story, a story of exodus
When you skip the pain, and looked up for happiness
(Yeah, look, look, yo, look, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
First breath and I'm into this Earth
The doctor knew it was spiritual, a miracle birth
I learned to speak immediately, fiddle with words
Get on my nerves, materials I didn't deserve
And from the first time I could catch a breath
I'd lay in bed, writin' poems on my Etch-A-Sketch
I'd sеt my steps up, climbin', I was straight to the top
An exodus, madе for the mic, and makin' it rock, yeah
This hip-hop could be heard from six blocks
I was raisin' the roof and just breakin' it off
'Cause before that I could ever walk or stand
My mom was bustin' hip-hop through the sonogram
So it seems only right to just bump it up
Hit this dick of a planet with a nickel bag of funk, yeah
A nickel bag of funk, a nickel bag of funk
Hit this dick of a planet with just a nickel bag of funk
 [Chorus: John Record]
What's the matter when you know it all?

You wanna pull the Shawshank freedom from your brain's wall
So you tell a story, a story of exodus
When you skip the pain, and looked up for happiness

[Post-Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
Start lookin' up
Start lookin' up (Yeah, look, yo, yo)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I'm lookin' up, my mind's above the clouds
For those who run they mouth, they ain't know what I'm about
What is now is the present, a gift, I'll leave it wrapped
My days are passin', my words are overlappin'
Hip-hop's a saga, get told with a lot a ganja
We sparked the marijuana, breathe deep
I'm not [?] God's offer [?] flowin' water
Grow that shit, roll that shit, smoke that shit
Saga continues, hip-hop is not an issue
I ain't got a tissue I could give you, ain't nobody with you
Battle mano a mano, no crowd, no audience
I'm not convinced that you have the confidence to talk some shit
I'm ominous, definition cadence, all-knowin'
I'm always kickin' it, spittin' whatever you call flow
I flow so much, my book erupts
My days are gone, I continue lookin' up
 [Chorus: John Record]
What's the matter when you know it all?

Picked up the pen and the ink started spillin' out
I'm so high, I believe that I can feel the clouds
So I hope y'all feel me now

Ashtray by me that I gotta dump my guts in
Need substance, feed it to the public
No one gon' touch it like my Poppy's old musket
Roll up to the function, eatin' all the Funyuns
Sentence keep runnin', word to double E Cummings
When people say to me it doesn't mean nothin'
Bumblebees buzzin' 'cause the trouble needs lovin'
Wonder who really give a fuck what I have to say?
Those are the people to which I dedicate this rap today
Your shit is fragile, if I have to I'ma crack your face
Monday to Saturday, I'm actin' like a basket case
While Sunday I'm goin' golfin' with my Callaway's
Or watchin' football, word to Joey Galloway
Take a shower, start singin' like Al Green
From outside, it probably sound like some loud screams
Always had child dreams and nightmares
My music like the airport, I hop on a flight there
Wanna go to Monaco to see what it's like there
Roll up in a pair of Nike Airs, just like, ""Yeah
Wassup?"" Here I am, lookin' in the mirror and
All I see is me, I'm at peace
Go rent out a penthouse, forget all my problems
The things I regret now be gone by the mornin'
My life is startin', I'm ready as I ever been
Pencil in my schedule that I gotta move on from mistakes
Number one albums, always givin' you mixtapes
And that's what I'ma do until I'm richer than Bill Gates
It ain't all about money for me, though
I do this for the people who need a boost in their ego
Work a lot, I'm an addict not a fiend, though
Get up, get out, and get somethin', word to Cee Lo
Bottles of Clicquot, a couple of Cristal
May head to L.A. like I'm Chris Paul

My milk and honey, my chérie-chérie amore
My Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway
Her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow
And the lion through the forest
To the Wicked Witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay
Remember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard
When he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard
Now the whole world's in color, still
How Auntie Em was next of kin but not her mother, real
Her face was careworn
I suspect she migrated from Kansas up from Dearborn
And had beef with Mrs. Gulch since the very beginnin' of year one
Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic
The poetry's like the poems and psalms of Ecclesiastes
Lightnin' should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet
The Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet
And yell, ""Hear, hear,"" finally some order to this rap shit
Finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips
I keep my shit crispy and elegant

Servin' pussy like the U.S. Open
Blowin' on this potent, different flavors, I done saw them all (Saw them all)
I be stayin' higher than the Taj Mahal, straight epic
So now you can't forget it
Kickin' girls out the crib like they got some bad credit (Peace)
When you blowed and you drunk (Drunk) and you ain't give a fuck
Take this soul and this funk (Funk), tell the DJ, ""Turn it up"" (Turn it up)
Purple stuff, got it stirrin' in my cup
With hoes, I get around like the wheels on the bus (Wheels on the bus)
I'm a true player, original Mac
And I keep the pussy poppin', here, listen to that
Hoes showin' me some love, so I'm givin' it back (Back, back)

And your girlie still wet from the last song
Ladies like, ""Mac Miller? Ooh, I wanna marry him"" (Haha)
'Cause if sex a drug, then I'm heroin

Twistin' somethin' purple, have us flyin' to a higher ground (Higher ground)
She love ridin' with the kid right here (Uh-huh)
She's still gon' be in love this time next year (Uh-huh)
'Cause I'm a heartbreaker, mover and shaker

Walkin' home alone to find some kids to whip they ass (Haha)

[Verse 1]
So many things to say, not a lot of time that I can say 'em
I can talk about the fact that I'm a rappin' Caucasian
Talk about goin' to school and gettin' bad grades
Talk about breakin' the rules and havin' bad days
I could talk about girl problems
I could talk about the hoes from the ugly to the hot ones
Or I could talk about this dream I have
Or I could talk about my homies when I seen 'em last
Say I'm the illest on the mic, how I kill it when I write
Or how the lights when they film is so bright
I could talk about the fame and the hoes
Or all the name brands on my clothes
Talk about the highs, talk about the lows
Talk about the high that you gettin' when you smoke
I talk about a lot of shit when I write

Look
I could talk about the parties that I go to
Talk about how it's so different from the old school
I could talk about the pop and the whack rap
Or I could talk about some ounces in the backpack
Talk about a fitted, talk about a snap back
Somethin' simple, or somethin' real abstract
About the war, talk about politics
Or I could tell you how full my Louis wallet is
I could talk about a few religions
Or how to turn a Jew into a Christian
I could talk about the shit that make you cry
Or I could make it all up and just talk about lies

[Chorus]
What type of music should I make?
It generates love and it generates hate (Hate)
What kind of topics should I stress?
I can talk about the money and the girls and the sex

Feeling like my bitch keepin' the answers in her panties, giggity
Fans who was the flows of the exhale
Nicotine smoker
I'm guillotine with the speech, been a Most Doper
There's no hope for man, I am sofer
I probably be forty, broke and with a combover
My mind dirty, I ain't fucking with these job turkeys (Job turkeys)
Yeah, okay, I've been up, I've been down
Man versus the wild

Shut your mouth, plead the fifth""
Spitting on girls while I stand on a cloud
Your bitch hands on the air, and her pants on the ground
So dance to thе sound when the band is in town
Do something with your lifе, stop standing around
What goes up, it comes down
What goes up, it comes down

Flow so water, like someone left the sink on
Never been a hater type

Oh you love the way I make you feel
Never felt a feeling like this, say it can't be real

Tell you once, tell you twice, everything is gon' be fine

Kickin' ass and taking names
I'm filled with passion
Keep the magic, it's fantastic, play the game
I lost my brain, I'm calling audibles
With God, we playing dominoes and Etch A Sketch
Never stress, often times we get depressed
But life goes on, that's what they told us from the start
Before things come together, see they have to fall apart
We swimmin' in a pool of sharks
You see, I'm full of heart
Tryna move my car, but I realize it's still in park
I'm tryna get up out the dark where the pain is
My brain is filled with so much trash, that’s why I waste it wasted
In the streets chasing pavements
Someone told me Jesus saves, he just need a couple days so be patient
I'm in a spaceship with untied laces
Never looking down, I guess I'm feeling good for now
I just want to make you proud
Build it up, then we break it down

https://genius.com/Mac-miller-thanks-for-comin-out-lyrics,"[Intro]
Yeah
Thank you, everybody, for comin' out
Listenin' to that Easy Mac
Shit's for Pittsburgh, that 412
So light up your blunts
We got time for one more
(Yeah) Aight?
You at the back of the Mac
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Easy Mac rap slick and sensational
Foolin' fools out they shoes like the first of April
I'm aimin' low, the words guaranteed to make 'em fold
I'll be remembered next December but your name'll go
My name remains, rhymes sent to your brain
Intentions disdained, these other cats resent and complain
My minds bettin' insane 'til the lyrics are complete
Spittin' fear in the ears of all those who compete
So I never skip a beat, the kid is Swisher Sweet
You can picture me cheesin' when my album hits the street
With the words too sick to speak, so I spit it in my sleep, fuck
Countin' sheep, I'm about to heat
Provin' anybody wrong who was doubtin' me
They say, ""Malcolm, please, get a new career""
It appears that they fear who I'll be in a year
'Cause I'm creatin' racket, makin' tracks up in the attic
See, my life changed after I heard Illmatic
It was drastic, automatic rappin', fantastic
I'm Jurassic, mic melts like plastic
I got the gift and you wish that you had it
So you study hip-hop and you read how-to-do's
Thinkin' that it's helpin' but you learnin' how to lose
See, I was born gifted, live to get lifted
If rappin' ain't my life, then what is it?
 [Interlude]
Yeah, yo
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Rhymes is my dome's home, on a gold throne
Spittin' sick, burnin' holes in the ozone
I rock clothes that don't fit me, flows, I spit quickly
And rip cities, kickin' clowns that hit middies
'Cause the Pitt's busy, I'm sorry, you just missed me
I can't bare what you spit 'cause it's grizzly
I kick shit you can't spit wit', nitwit, sit quick
And let me twist back my Pitt fit
The best yet, blessed to catch wreck
In fresh sweats with more words and less rest
Your next guest with more swords for pressed pests
The rest sweat, for war is the next step (Chyeah)
I got a passion for rappin'
I'm passin' up has-beens with passive reactions
You askin' for action? I'm clashin' up your atoms
Your ass'll get flattened, be askin', ""What happened?""

[Interlude]
Yeah, look

[Verse 3]
I'm sleep deprived, but managin' to keep my mind
And when rest tries to find me, I seek to hide
Bleed from my eyes, they've been open for too long
My body needs sleep but these demons is too strong
My insomnia lets me spit a monologue
Stayin' up writin' as the night is goin' on and on
Out my mind, I'm a maniac, insane with rap
Raises, now my brain describes players playin' haters act
Traitors need to watch they back 'cause I know just where they at
Scared of rap be where I'm at
Lookin' and I'm starin' back
Hatin'? Say ya prayers
And that Pittsburgh, that's where I'm at
We true hip-hop, we the rarest cats
 [Outro]
Yeah, it's Easy Mac, Mackin' Ain't Easy
Get at me, yo
Pittsburgh, where you at? Stand up"
https://genius.com/Mac-miller-thats-on-me-lyrics,"[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know

[Verse 1]
Time moving slowly, I'm bouncing my head off the wall
I know nobody that knows where we're going at all
Don't, don't, don't, don't let me down
And I'll pick you up, I'll help you get around

[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know

[Bridge]
I'll let it go
I'll cut the strings
Today I'm flying

[Verse 2]
I don't know where I've been lately, but I've been alright
I said good morning this morning and I'll say good night
Don't, don't, don't, don't wait around
We'll take the stairs that gets us here to there
It's unfair when I'm being too proud, but
 [Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know"

Yeah, said I

[Verse 1]
Made a promise with my deranged conscious
In return he told me the voice in my head would quiet down
All I gotta do is never speak of his existence or eternal soul
Otherwise it's terminal
And I hate to worry those
With my dirty nose and my perverted ways
It hurts me that I hurt you
Never meant to cause a person pain
Deteriorate a skeleton, regurgitate my vertebrae
Lord, I beg your mercy
Can you take me on a perfect day?
I always wondered what determines fate
And who's tendin' to the garden by the pearly gates
They don't want you to be anything but what they tell you
Sell you on a lie and watch the murder rate circulate
Lord merciful
He ride around heaven in his '69 convertible
No shirt beneath the purple coat
Known to get surgical at the turkey bowl
He throw a baseball like a motherfuckin' girl though

[Chorus]
What is this underworld you speak of
And why is everybody tryna teach us?
Why is it considered so rude to walk around in the nude
And why do we hurt the ones that we love?
Yeah, I always wondered if Jesus had a ego
Insecurities when he got emo
Why do I insist on goin' over your head?
Why don't I just make hits?
Gotta be so weird
 [Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
I've been awake for so long, I feel myself disintegratin'
But I'll never stop the innovation
I'm addicted to creation, that's the world's greatest miracle
My vehicle, no one told me how to steer it though
I'm toyin' with my hallucinations
Hope it don't spoil and turn into inferno
I'm lost in the wormhole, searchin' for the hurt souls
Watchin' as the germs grow
Take over the Earth slow
I'm unaware in a comfy chair sippin' Merlot
Waitin' 'til I hear my number called and it's my turn to go
Insomnia, oh, how I always get along witcha
They don't want us to be friends, but I'm so fond of ya
And I can stay in Narnia forever
The human brain couldn't measure how the pleasure feel
I disagree with what they said was real
And, if this a war I need a better shield
Yeah

[Outro]
This ain't nothin' but another idea to be forgotten at the bottom of a drawer in my apartment, lost
I tried to bargain with the man upstairs
I just hope I got a fan up there"

Roll a lil' something up so we can all get high
Get some people up, let em' all inside

We're clowning around, get right for the night with some drink and some ice
It's just a Sunday night
There is not much to do now
Laying back with the tunes loud
Time to cool out

Life, life, life

[Verse 1]
How do you know way more than I do?
How do you have it all figured out?
How do you have connections with the truth, and know what everything we hear is all about?
Pain, how I feel don't got to be explained
I remain somewhere in the family of insane
My brain knows too much, but it knows nothin' at all
I've been called a liar, I've been called an addict
I've been at a low when the high is automatic
I've been needed a jacket in this freezin' planet
When the world was gonna end, I didn't even panic
I just want to know what happens when the dreamеrs vanish
I can hide it with a smile, so you won't see the damagе
Somebody once told me that I wasn't shit, I believed her
Tried to do anything to please her
But as I laid beneath her and realized I could no longer reach her
I fell out, and let her tell me I'm a sellout
No more help, I put this belt down
A battle in your own head is pretty common though
When you only exist through an audio stream
They wouldn't hear me if I screamed
They'll never know that they all are figments of a dream (Dream)
I wish I could just sit for a while (While), with no responsibility
Just observe all the other people and the words that they use
That would be some tranquility
Sometimes, I hate when they film me
Sometimes, the things in my mind become filthy
I just pray that I'm normal too, even though we all seek to be exceptional
That's why we invent the unconventional, and live life like it's just a festival
Nobody take me serious with all this gold
I just want the wisdom that you have when you get old
They say I gotta wait for that, but I never liked to do as I was told
When the world goes cold, no nutrients to grow, then will you be so bold? (Bold)
I kinda feel like I'm a piece of mold, ready to be cleaned by the system
Fuck, who am I kiddin'?
I got a world to change, I need to stop bitchin' (Bitchin'), truth
 [Chorus]
The difference of addiction and use (Uh)
The difference between addiction and use (It's kind of funny)
The difference between addiction and use (The things that make you feel comfortable)
The difference between addiction and use

[Verse 2]
As the world turns, and we wait to meet demise
Wonder if divine life meets us when the time's right
With no proof or scientific evidence, only then can believe and become relevant
Seek rebirth, need time to settle in
Then I'll get up again, and see the things I never did
Is this me speakin', or is it someone else?
Are these my own thoughts, or is it just the dope talkin'?
I've learned about life through love
So how do we inform those of us who have never felt the touch of
A goddess when she vulnerable? I'm givin' my condolence to you
If you never felt that feelin', I just hope that you do
It's somethin' kind of hard to comprehend, when your life on the end
I leave things behind that always slip my mind
Because my mind is always elsewhere
I guess I feel myself there, a place where space is erased, I never felt scared
That's why givin' up feel satisfying
Didn't have to try to turn the water back to wine
The impossible is tempting, as an areola when it's there, never haven't felt aware
It's hard to breathe when you care, the moment I was drowning, you were coming up for air (Air)
I wish that I could make you understand, I just want to see my mother dance
If I fuck it up, I'm prayin' for another chance
You could never feel euphoria as lovers can (Lovers can)
I fuckin' am, I said I fuckin' am gone"

Yeah, yeah
Let me get a little bit more beat
Yeah

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Ask God if she believe in me and will she accept me as a deity
And tell me the secrecy won't keep you free
I'm sleeping, won't dream until the demons leave
I took a nap, beneath a tree in the shade
Feel the sharpness of the swords and blades of grass
Picturin' the images that make you laugh
I left you out to die, but will you take me back? (Back)
Somewhere in between the crazy and the conscious (Conscious)
She's naked underneath them shadows
Let the sunlight undress her slow
I don't know who I am, I'm so good at doin' impressions though (Uh-huh)
I'm goin' to the festival, (The festival) need to let me go
I wake up, pop a couple Benadryls, go back to sleep
It's all made up, everything they said was real, it has to be
'Cause actually the master fast asleep
And the castles back-back in his private quarters (Private quarters)
That's a master for you, this a revolution, we don't have no order (No, no, no)
All this torture, thought I had to warn ya (Had to warn ya)
Leave it all behind and go to California (California) (Go, go)
I'm past the signs, it's the real thing, try analyzin' this feelin'
Ya can't fathom (Can't fathom) (Can't, can't, can't)
 [Bridge: Yukimi Nagano]
(Festival, festival, festival, festival)
My hands are above the clouds
From the clap-clap thunder lookin' down
While you're runnin' around
I lift you up when you drown
Unlock the mission, the planet in rotation
Full speed chasin' and you're always runnin' ahead
You're always runnin' ahead
You got second chances, happy birthday, sweet romances
And you battle like a champion, why
Do you wanna go, do you wanna go
Do you wanna go to the festival?
You got angels weepin', see them drippin' from the sky
You watch 'em with your third eye (So, so, so)
Do you wanna go, do you wanna go
Do you wanna go to the festival? (To the festival)
To the festival (To the festival)
To the festival (To the festival)
Festival (Festival)
Festival (Festival)

You know the finer things in life, you know (They know, they know)
Sometimes you gotta kick back and enjoy that shit
Look, just relax (Roll that sticky up) (It's summertime, bitch, haha)

[Verse 1]
I like sittin' in shotgun, deuce on a L (Deuce on a L)
Parents not carin' 'cause they used to the smell
Classy-ass women, fresh-ass linen (Yeah)
Hot summer days with a pool I can swim in (Cheah)
A good spot to kick it (What?), a case of 40's
Them homies always havin' good stories (Yep)
The beer bottles with the twist-off caps (Uh-huh)
When old people tell you that they listen to rap
I love days I can sleep in (Sleep in), four day weekends (Weekends)
Hoes puttin' they clothes back on, you peekin' (I see you, haha)
Blunt rides, with a mixtape bumpin' (Uh-huh)
I love makin' love in public
And when the hip-hop legend tour comin' to your town (Comin' to your town)
Findin' a crispy-ass twenty on the ground (Yep)
Walkin' when the sun out, watchin' Run's House (That was a good show, haha)
Or action movies when the villain pull his gun out

[Chorus]
The best things in life is the free ones
The little things, everybody need some (Haha)
The finer things make you feel better (Yeah, better)
But no one ever seem to remember (Yeah)
The best things in life is the free ones (Uh-huh)
The little things, everybody need some (Ha-ha)
The finer things make you feel better
But no one ever seem to remember (What else, uh)
 [Verse 2]
I like sleepin' in class and cheatin' to pass (Uh-huh)
Hoes walkin' in the halls and you reach for they ass (Sup?)
Fast food lines when they movin' so quickly (What? So quickly)
When your weed man hit you with some sticky
Street performers, warmin' up the corners
Sellin' by the ounce, then pinchin' by the quarter (Gimme that)
When some kicks on sale (Uh-huh)
Wakin' up in the mornin' with a shitload of mail
The wake up, the bake up, chillin' while you face blunts
Goin' in blowed for your shape-up like, ""Say what?"" (Say what?)
Blog put your tape up, get a good review
When dumbass people tell you what you shouldn't do (Fuck y'all)
When she rub my head while I'm between her knees, haha
Gettin' love from the people overseas (Ciao)
Haters tryna hate, but they got nothin' to say (Yeah)
It's just the little things that get me through the day (What?)

[Chorus]
The best things in life is the free ones (The free ones)
The little things, everybody need some (Everybody need some)
The finer things make you feel better (Make you feel better)

The best things in life is the free ones (The free ones)
The little things, everybody need some (Everybody need some)

Another thousand years until we feelin' Heaven's touch
I work around the clock, twenty-four-seven-plus
She love it when we fuck, so she gon' let me fuck
I finally got it all, still I can't get enough
I'm landin' on the green, but hittin' out the rough
Your eyes is on the screen, I bеt they miss a lot
They throwin' flowers at my feet, but don't forgеt me not
No opinions, I'm feelin' so mint condition, I swear
You always missin' the point, but still you swing a lot
You can bring your women, but don't bring your thots
We open up your mind, you think before we talk

Yeah, and all I'm asking of you is just to let me live
I might just fuck the world up if I ever leave the crib
My house is on the hill, my hands ain't on the wheel
I'm lettin' go of it all, no, this is not a drill (Um)
Well, I still whip the wagon with this shit up loud
Mind my business, Pirate-fitted, make my city proud
Are you entertained?
Bullshitin', few million goin' down the drain
Do you listen?
Feed you with a spoon, this a soup kitchen
Never had a lot, now my room's got room in 'em (Room in 'em)
Standin' on the moon, heal my wounds
Stroke my ego, turn my head to a balloon too soon
I know the world got doors they leave open
And what go up might keep floatin'
I just wanna feel it till I feel it no more
If there ain't a ceilin', then

[Chorus]
The floor is yours (I bet you're sick of waiting always)
(Better make a move, you're takin' up space)
The floor is yours (One day it'll have to go my way)
(So I gotta stay ready just in case)
The floor is yours (I don't need no extras either)

I'm goin' swimmin', I ain't chillin' no more

[Chorus]
Life a bitch that I wanted to date, but just led me on
Now I'm goin' for another one
Put me in the friend zone, lovin' how we get along
But she wouldn't let me fuck her once
You gotta take life for what it is
But everybody just tell us that we a bunch of kids
This shit ain't nothin' big, it's just the game of life
So, motherfucker, how you playin'?

[Verse 1]
In this game of life, I'm just beginnin'
Only the first innin', but how much they payin' to get admission?
Oh, nothin'? They just listenin'?
It's all good, 'cause I’m just tryin' to make a livin'
This planet that we livin' on, streets people spittin' on
Got this cold world in my hand, I put some mittens on
They playin' dirty so my bib is on
Why they hatin' on the stars that they wish upon?
Twinkle, twinkle, a wrinkle in time
I got these motherfuckers hatin' 'cause they wish they could shine
But they can't and I can
So they stand while I dance with their bitch
With my hands on her hips and she ask me
""Can you take me to the crib?"" (Haha)
Well, bitch, that wouldn't be too classy
I'm sick of all the same advice
Motherfucker, this the game of life, so how you playin'?

It ain't smart, I'm playin' risky in this game of life
Roll the dice, just try and get my paper right
When the heat's on, most of y'all made of ice
So you pay the price, but I'm here to save your life
You the type to never ever take advice
The world is a girl who ain't playin' right
Everybody love life 'cause it sound nice
But you can't turn a ho to a housewife
Everybody tried but they failed
Oh well, light another L
Ha, I guess the show goes on
You had her naked, now her clothes is on, what's wrong?

Life a bitch that I wanted to date, but just led me on

Tell a bitch she outie if you smell of fish, hell no

Never hear the end of it
Laughin' with your friends like some degenerates
But be nice, these females' feelings are kinda delicate
Never get the etiquette

So fly, baby, buzzin' like an insect
Buggin' every track that I infest, been best
Simple intellect, feelin' that I've been up next
Feeling all the interest in puttin' all the hate to rest
No atheist, but self-made
Great team, we just tryna get ourselves paid
Never been on E, all my boosters pump gas for me
Gassed up like a Hummer for the summer
And everything I did was a runner for the numbers
All the critics got a woody, the foundation with the lumber
Fronters, ha, will never get no shine
Y'all struggle through life, and we just gon' glide
Hop on the bandwagon, squeeze for the ride
Trees for the trip, beans for my high
Reach for the sky, yeah, it's worth a try
But you still couldn't touch a man this fly

And now we go front, back, side to side
Everybody just glide
If you gettin' high, throw your hands in the sky

Look at 'em laughin' like, ""Pass that weed""
Haven't made a weed song in a minute though
'Cause I've been gettin' dough, now it's back to gettin' smoke
Have a muhfucker high on her tippy toes
Then zip a O, now you smokin' with a pro
So what you know about that?
You smoke weed, what you know about wax?
Haha, cookin' it up
At the airport, TSA lookin' at us
You used to smoke that dirt, you couldn't adjust
When you had to hit that kush
You was used to the bush like W. George
Come hit this killer and I promise that you gonna end up sittin' in the morgue
Most Dope blow the most smoke, that's a fact, bitch
Plus-size section with my blunt, that's a fat bitch
Why you smokin' on that [?]?
Why you even have it? Pillow tight weed on my mattress
You now rockin' with TreeJay, Clockwork the DJ
Smokin' another after that, replay
Most Dope, muhfucker, this The Grow Op
My weed stinkin' like Justin with no socks
Yeah, I'm a show off, probably has him mad as fuck
I'll give him bars, I'm Bugs Bunny, he Daffy Duck
What you lookin' at, muhfucker? Pass the blunt
""Lucky Ass Bitch"" video, where is it? Cut, cut, cut, cut
Like a eighthy though, these other crews smoke less than the Navy though
Find me smokin' blunts with Fran and Vinny Radio
That's The Come Up, smoke until the sun's up
Light another blunt (Light it up)
Yeah, muhfucker, this The Grow Op"

Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill (Chill)
This a muthafuckin' barbecue, for real (Real)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch (Punch)
Grandma gettin' crunk, just fun
Nobody give a fuck (Fuck)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time (Hey, hey, hey)

The door's open, I might as well just stroll in
Got some Arnie Palmer in my pitcher: call it Nolan
Ryan, try it once and then you go there
I am hopin' that we can kick it, reminiscin' only about the good times
I know there's moments when you probably love me, but you didn't wanna show it
Now I'm all around the globe, with everyone but you
I know you fuckin' miss me, chill and keep it cool
Never gettin' old, mane, grown, no Rogaine
Fill your plate with all that food, you better eat the whole thing
This a family reunion, all the grandmas be movin'
Runnin' in three-legged races, people would cry if they losin'
When I was two, my slide was blue
When I was gone, my ice cream cone was a giant wand
When my bike was all I was ridin' on
Jewelry from a Happy Meal, fuck it, I was happy still

Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill (Chill)

Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time (Hey)

[Verse 2]
Come and step inside the Electric Slide
Sprayin' squirt guns at you like it's pesticide
So why you buggin'? Lil' man, stop buggin'
I gotta spend some time with some friends of mine
Get away from everything, go and rest your mind
It's not nothin', lil' man, it's not nothin'
All my little cousins actin' like some munchkins
Runnin' into trees, end up cryin' out their eyes
Have to rush 'em to the ER, maybe just a Band-Aid will do it
You can sing along, please let the band play the music
Always nice you can come back home
Your friends go off, but then they come back grown
Nice to know that you never alone
Family reunions whenever I'm home

I'm all up inside of your brain, droppin' grenades
I'ma go hop on a plane that will take me away
Intelligent, never been sane, bitch, my shit is legendary
The crazy baby that lived inside of a pregnant Mary (Pregnant Mary)
Sex and candy, money, love, protect your family
How I dress is fancy, trust me, my collection varies
She got some extra fanny, wearin' nothin' 'cept her panties
Papa was a proper player, pimpin' is hereditary (Hеreditary)
They put you in a box like somе old clothes (Old clothes)
We diamonds in the sky that's made of rose gold (Rose gold)
In Soho, takin' photos of some dope hoes with no clothes
Tell 'em, ""Pose, it might get in Vogue"" (Get in Vogue)
I heard somebody tell me less is more (Less is more)
And the truth is somethin' none of us may ever know (Ever know)
Why you holdin' on? You need to let her go (Let her go)
And watch her wander through the festival (Festival)

What if we ran away, had ourselves a little fantasy?
Would you want to stay, if I found a place we'd escape?
And if it takes a while, along the journey, I'ma make you smile
Is there somethin' you believe in?
Me and you can taste freedom, if there's somethin' you believe in

If there somethin' you believe in
Me and you can taste freedom
Believe in freedom

Uh, remember the moment in time (Time) you said you was mine?
I'm sick of this everyday life (Life), with no more design
Why don't we get us a place away from this society?
From expectations, and stable thought, and sobriety (Sobriety)
Just 'cause they lookin' don't mean eyes can see
I know some miracles that make it so the blind can see (Blind can see)
All I'm doin' isn't shit if it's compared to that
I just got hoes all dressed in black, tryna marry Mac (Marry Mac)
Wrote these words on top an iPhone with a cracked screen
When karma come to me with blessings, guess I'll fuck him up (Fuck him up)
Still wake up every night havin' these bad dreams
I guess that means I haven't done enough
We want to rush, but can't
There's so much that we want to do, I'm down to take a chance
Sometimes you need to stop a moment, only to advance
Confusin' fuckin' world I'm tryna figure out
But girl, the weed is lit, my dick is out (Dick is out)

What if we ran away, had ourselves a little fantasy?
Would you want to stay, if I found a place we'd escape?

Mornin' after, my lungs hurt
Eat your pussy just to show you how my tongue works
It's funny how we fucked but fell in love first
Been three years, I wish I finally trust her
She make me feel like how them drugs work
Itchin' for my fixture, when she gone the love hurts
I just get her temper, I just need somebody I can vent to
Someone get me stoned, be my Emma
Left your lipstick on the glass of your daiquiri
Ruby red, usually end up tragically
Work of art, you could be my masterpiece
But you fast asleep

Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before
I hope one day it all makes sense
It'll all make sense
And you could have it all, tell me what you need
Believin' all them silly things you read
I hope one day it all makes sense
One day it'll all make sense

Uh
Then she wake up, cryin' while she puttin' on her make-up
Trapped inside her love for me, ain't no escape for her
You wanna leave? Say the word, but she can't
Lookin' in my eyes, ""Is everything okay?""
She lies, put on her disguise, play it safe
'Cause we've been fightin' for the past three weeks
She keep this one inside, she don't wanna seem weak
Strong, baby, tell me what's been goin' on
I don't wanna be sober long
So you need to get me high again
I got all this money we could try to spend
Until we strung out like a violin
Come back to life, then we die again
Little angel, where's your halo?
Somewhere above them horns

Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before

I hope one day it all makes sense
One day it'll all make sense

Uh
You get me high, girl, scared to overdose
I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose
May I propose a toast? Someone usually does
To our fucked up love
You get me high, girl, scared to overdose
I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose
Propose a toast? Someone usually does
To our fucked up love

Said, ""Baby, what you doin' tonight? (Hello)
We could watch the world get ruined tonight,"" livin' this life
Got you flexin', feelin' colder than ice, let it melt
As we follow all the stupid advice (Okay), and I don't usually like
To be this honest wit' ya (Honest wit' ya), I must have lost the picture (Lost the picture)
Gimme a box of swishers, room full of obnoxious bitches (Got you)
Why you lyin' to me? Just grab your ladies
That Mercedes all kinds of roomy, and when the times are gloomy
Hit me up (Huh?) I can make you feel like that perfect girl you wish you was (Was)
Givin' you that feelin' like when Christmas come (When Christmas come)
I just take all of my problems, throw 'em in the blunt
Light 'em up and watch 'em float away, ayy (That smoke)

Watch 'em float
I can take you anywhere that you wanna
Go
Can you dream?

[Verse 2]
I'm back on these rap songs (Okay), feelin' they're never gonna last long (Okay)
Got a shortcut, baby? I'll pass on it, my dick, throw your ass on it (Blaow)
Pass the time, ask for my alibi, tryna tell you I need that (I need that)
Just relax (Just relax), put that money in my motherfuckin' hand (In my hand)
Take another pull, goddamn (Goddamn), ain't part of the plan
Like a car in a van, I'm rollin', I'm feelin' good, I'm golden
My man (My man), let me just do my dance (My dance)
'Cause, ma'fucker, this my jam, said this my jam, this my jam (This my motherfuckin' jam)
How many times you 'bout to let them opportunities pass you by?
I used to be a pretty passive guy (Uh-huh), since before I was a goddamn mastermind (Woo!)
In that castle of mine, I came up in half the time as these lame fucks
You can't rush that greatness, that mansion where my maid lives

Like, woah, watch 'em float
I can take you anywhere that you wanna
Go (That you wanna go)

Penis and Vagina
Yeah, yeah, yeah, said
Too much cash on me
(Make a baby will you?)
Yeah, said, I got

[Verse 1]
I got, uhm too much cash on me
I’m path lonely, walking through the world with a mask on me
The pastor told me all I needed was matrimony, but that ain’t half as holy as it used to be
I choose to be a fake, manipulator for my own sake
Too paranoid to leave it up to fate, there’s nothing left but to wait for the answer
I can’t wrap my head around the question that I need to ask, what do I believe in?
There’s a world behind the window, try to see in
Increase the demons that are praying on my downfall
A pack of cigarettes and alcohol, my medicine
Cocaine residue, I’m cleaning up the evidence
Except the worst shit been better since, tell the devil to take a swing, but I never flinch
Yeah, he’ll forever miss

Where do you wanna go?
Can you make it on your own?

Yeah, well, said, uhm
How you doing?
Well I’m fine, it’s so nice you took the time out your schedule to level with me, it’s never been so easy before
The people find conclusions, and then leave me at war
In the dark, I lost my sun word to Mr. Shakur
How does it feel to be confused?
How does it feel to be used and thrown into the pool
Lead tied to your shoes, dance with death under the light of the moon
They all say it’s too soon, but I’ll go
I’ll leave and they’d all wonder where I went, but they know its all just an entertainment for the show
‘Cause everybody need ratings
Take a different path, we all searching for the same things
Calculating the chance that I’ll make it through the hatred, should I keep it vague for him
I'm too sick, give him a dose of the plague for him
I won't spend another day mourning

Where do you wanna go?
Can you make it on your own?

Hey, hey, hey

92 'til infinity and beyond (Hey)
And on (I hear it's like—), and on (I hear it's kinda like—)
And on (I hear it's kinda like—), and on (I hear it—)

[Verse 1]
Hey, I heard they got nice cars up in Heaven
Free liquor out the bar and the brightest fuckin' stars up in Heaven
Heard that you can chill, not worry 'bout the police
Not worry 'bout someone fightin' 'cause everything just at peace
Heard the streets paved with gold, the women all gorgeous
You just float, can't even feel where the floor is
I heard Heaven got a brand new venue
Next to that restaurant, you love their menu
And everything free, so everyone cool
Look out any window, it's an incredible view
Everyone you speak to always tellin' you the truth
And it's only good shit when you gettin' all your news
Ooh, I imagine that
Just a place that we can kick it, be happy at
Satisfaction or maybe I'm dreamin'
Tell you what it's like when I see it

[Chorus]
If you hear what Heaven's like, can you tell me?
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done
Shit, I'm just tryin' to go
If you hear what Heaven's like, could you tell me?
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done
Shit, I'm just tryin' to go
 [Verse 2]
I heard ain't nobody famous up in Heaven, everybody the same
Just kick it up there in Heaven 'cause nobody goin' change
Nobody can complain, the parties are all insane
The people all know your name, shit, you entertain
See everybody you want, always keepin' in touch
And go and chill by yourself when everything get too much
Never a fuckin' rush, you there for a million plus
You probably got a Mercedes, but always could take the bus
So fuck, that's what Heaven's like, I guess I think it is
But come to think of it, I've been drinkin' shit, I don't know the truth
This is what I imagined when I was standin' in the booth, haha

[Chorus]
If you hear what Heaven's like, can you tell me?
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done

Light the weed
Wish that you would stay, you got the right to leave
It's who I'd like to be
You say I may be losin' sight of things, and I might agree
But we livin' in a digital world
You told me that you wasn't a material girl
Then I realized those don't exist
Freedom of the mind, that's the only bliss
And they told me, ""No,"" but I did it, ain't got shit for these bitches
Livin' life with no limits, days becomin' so different
Get money, fuck hoes, when your eatin', your stomach grow
Who is that? Love to know
It's perfect here, it doesn't show
Makin' music just because I love to
If you hatin' on me, sayin', ""Fuck you""
And it's simple, but it means a lot
This is what I do, I don't need to talk

[Verse 2]
Ya, I tried to do a lot of things
Couldn't focus on everything
I think I'm really good at many things
A phone's calling, that's the devil's ring
I'm not gonna answer that phone
I'm ready to go back home
Been on this road for so long, that all I do is sit and make sad songs
What the fuck happened to that nice kid
That you knew when he released that mixtape called K.I.D.S
And everybody thought that he would be so big
Until he lost focus 'cause he got so sick
Of all the bullshit that they always do, tell you what you gotta do
Everybody's watching you, and you just wanna scream an Awprah
I think I need to see a doctor
 [Outro]
Keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', yo, I got somethin' to say
When this motherfuckin' hook ends, I got somethin' to say
I'm not finished, I ain't slowin' down for nothin'
This my motherfuckin' time, and I'ma do this shit
'Cause I was meant to do this motherfuckin' shit
Yeah, motherfu—uh, shit, yeah, uh
The funny thing—the funny thing is
This song isn't just a song because I dreamed of this song
In past days and I woke up and it was the future
It's funny when the future is things you dreamed
Because you never understand what they mean at the time
But then in the forward of motion of seconds and minutes and hours
You finally realized that they were all secret messages
From people you don't know but you might have seen in a past life or a life in the future
Or whatever the fuck this whole thing means that you just will never figure out
So stop trying!"

Welcome back to K.I.D.S., um
Follow your dreams

Wanna get a mansion, a jacuzzi
A theater to watch my movies
Couple whips and lots of fancy things
The kids they call the Goonies
I see the future, crystal ball
Mirror mirror hangin' on the wall
Who the flyest white boy of them all?
Got your girlfriend screenin' all the calls
She bubblin', we fuckin', then you cuddlin'
Like, baby, where the fuck you been?
Don't wanna tell you she in love with him
So, so we ain't sayin' nothin'
You could probably tell she bluffin'
'Cause she kiss you with the mouth
She gave me head with my concussion
Yeah, she blushin', all red
Wanna rush and go to bed
You interrogate that bitch like you the feds
So she says she in love with a rockstar, rockstar
Wanna smoke my weed, so she asks me where the tops are, tops are

Obsessed with me
Undress a freak on ecstasy

Hallelujah, thank God I have a future
Prayin' I don't waste it gettin' faded
'Cause I'm smokin' **** until I'm coughin' up tar
Feel the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard, I still read Babar
Trippin' out, lookin' at a bunch of Google map stars
Shit, they got a app for that

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
But me, I'm still trapped inside my head
It kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm livin' paradise, so what I have to worry 'bout?
Dealin' with these demons, feel the pressure, find the perfect style (Perfect style)
Makin' sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience a touch of my epiphany in color form
Difference between love and war inform me, I'm above the norm (Above the norm)
Give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhymin' like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music 'gainst my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm runnin' from, but I'm runnin' still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothin' real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fuckin' deal (Fuckin' deal)
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls-Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you don't talk about some money, I'ma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's lettin' me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go (Let 'em go)
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow (Would let it slow)
That's just me all wildin' out and bein' extra though (Extra though)
Yeah
 [Verse 2: Mac Miller]
And if God was a human, it'd be yours truly
Watchin' horror movies with some foreign groupies
Thinkin' this decor suits me (This decor suits me)
I do drugs, get more loopy
I'm in tune to ancient jiu-jitsu spirituals, it's blissful (It's blissful)
Lookin' out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet (Could finally meet)
I think I'm JFK's final speech
They try assassinatin' all of my beliefs
(But I'm asleep) So whisper to me for the peace of mind
And he be high, some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine (Shrine)
Twenty thousand on my watch 'cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine (Be divine)
Yeah, can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same (Not the same)
I'm lookin' out my window, ashin' on the pane (Ashin' on the pane)
Shit, wonder if I lost my way (Lost my way)

[Verse 3: Delusional Thomas]
Yeah, don't you ever wanna hide away? (Hide away)
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today (Die today)
I'll greet the devil with a smilin' face (Smilin' face)
Shit, that God fellow may reside in space
As, times are wastin', I'm freebasin' with Freemasons
My girl's switchin' the locks, the keys keep changin' (Keep changin')
Dreamin' of places, my own personal creations
If there's a party in Heaven I plan to leave wasted (Leave wasted)
Retracin' my steps way back to Biblical times
We-we all gon' end up meetin' at the finishin' line

And these words that I command you today shall be in your heart
And you shall teach them diligently to your children
And you shall speak of them when you sit at home

Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother
My mind is my weapon, I'm lettin' it go
Know that I'm pointin' at negative energy, tellin' me ""Stop""
They tellin' me ""No""
Your aura is somethin' you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, hoes got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feelin' come after the shock
Praise me, I'd rather you not, 'cause
It's drivin' me crazy
The fact that you pay to make me into somethin' I love
You come to the club, searchin' for drugs, drunk, fuckin' these sluts
God loves me, what if he does, what does it mean?
You're wastin' away doing nothin', you're frontin'
Why ain't you chasin' your dreams? Uh
We wonder 'bout life but none of us willin' to learn
The money we earn is somethin' to burn
Why won't they give me a turn–out?
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You're mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When them high-rollers homes in Vegas raided with some home invasion
Contaminatin' the place with plague, we just saved the day

Okay, forfeitin' the war, he lays his sword down and walks away
Grabs a forty from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealin' with death like he work in the morgue
Absorbin' souls forgotten, he lost his way
Starin' down that barrel, thinkin', ""Not today""
Life's so precious, said Lord knows life is so precious
Fight to the death, 'til there's nobody left
You're holdin' your breath 'cause you might get infected
Minimalistic, instinctively thinkin' of gettin' ballistic
Be specific, to those in control, we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itchin', all I kill is time *Gunshot*
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shootin' lasers
'Cept I'm cool with Vader, blowin' up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor the youth can relate to, it's nature
If you a hater, I'll deal with you later, no, thank ya
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors

I'm in tune to ancient jiu-jitsu spirituals, it's blissful (it's blissful)
Lookin' out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet (Finally meet)
I think I'm JFK's final speech (Final speech)
Try assassinatin' all of my beliefs (My beliefs)
I'm asleep, so whisper to me for the peace of mind
And he be high, some weed to grind on top of Jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch 'cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine (Be divine)
Can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same (Not the same)

I'm a smooth criminal (DJ Capcom; criminal), put your life on critical (Uh-huh)
Move miracles, smokin' blue medicinals (Yep)
Duckin' 'cause the jakes (Uh-huh) don't know the hustle for the cake (Uh-huh)
Seekin' somethin' I can take, like all the money in the bank (Chyeah)
Guns, check, bags, check, suits, ammo, and masks, check
Now we ready to go, waitin' for the driver
Got a homie watchin' cops like MacGyver (Haha)
I'ma try to go by the book
Captain Hook, I'ma crook, look (Look)
Stealin' just a hobby, son (Uh-huh), and it's a lot of fun (Chyeah)
You need a Tommy gun? I'ma go and cop me one
Life's been nice (Been nice), but you don't live twice (Live twice)
So when they give you a chance, you better spin dice
Takin' it all, doin' it big, duckin' from the boys in blue and the pigs
Arrive (Arrive) at 19th and 5th Street
Look at the bank, give a Grinch grin, big cheeks
Stealin' more than Christmas, cheddar by the pound
Robbin' and stealin', then coppin' them wheels, then lettin' off a round (Chyeah)
Tip-toe on that Pink Panther tip
Don't panic, bitch, and everyone will get a hand of chips (Haha)
Glide to the entrance, walk up to the stairs
Start shootin' our guns up in the air

This a stick-up, everybody down on the ground
Feel me now, motherfucker?
This a stick-up, put them hands in the air

You heard the man (DJ Capcom; heard the man), come up out them pockets (Yep)
Empty out ya wallets, necklaces, and watches (Haha)
All the guap, and don't call the cops
I'd hate to have to watch as you all get shot, ha
There's someone at the door, knock-knock-knock-knock
Good thing we got the door locked (Haha)
Now show me to the vault (Vault), show me to the cash
Been rippin' and spittin' this right, you don't even gotta ask (Uh-huh)
Got class like a mobster, high school Sinatra (Sinatra)
Stay relaxed with a hit from the ganja
Calm, cool, collected, told Billy to shoot
Bullet shot through the air; gimme the loot, gimme the loot (Haha)
The bank teller (Teller), well, he took us to the back
Lookin' like a black cat crossed his path
Well, that's exactly what we goin' for (Uh-huh)
Pulled out his key to open the door
There was money to the ceilin' (Ceilin'), cake skyscrapers (Skyscrapers)
Enough paper to pay five Lakers
Gold and silver, diamonds and jewels (Jewels)
Anything you wanted you could find in this room (Gimme that)
Now my whole team rich, I don't believe this
This some straight-up Ocean's Thirteen shit
Jesse James, gettin' change, I'm an outlaw
And my boys let 'em bang, pull 'em out, draw
With all this thoughts about livin' like gaudy (Gaudy)
We forgot about them people in the lobby (Lobby)
Told the posse, ""It's time to break""
The cake piles down the aisle of the bank
 [Chorus]
(Huh?) This a stick-up, everybody down on the ground
Feel me now, motherfucker?
This a stick-up, put them hands in the air
Let me get that there, uh
This a stick-up, everybody down on the ground

Champion of the tournament, the world's ornament
Fallin' to the Earth just to show you that we porcelain
Colder than Nova Scotia, was local but no exposure
I told 'em the show was over, it's all on both of my shoulders

Please, things ain't always what they seem to be
'Cause, me, I got dreams to be the greatest MC
Muhammad Ali with punchlines that sting like a bee
But I float like a butterfly, prove this nation I'm the god
What am I? A coward, only if I run from God? (Yeah)
From the bottom I came, to the top of my game
Rippin' and spittin' licks off the top of the brain (Uh)
I spit heat, fireman, why you stoppin' my flames?
Nothin' makes sense, so you can find me shoppin' for change
It's comin' from Nas, he told us that the world is ours
I spit SARS, can't talk, gotta lock my jaws
I got the Earth in my paws, and the stars in my eyes

The sky seems lonely, why don't we get high? (Say what?)
The sky seems lonely, why don't we get high? (Say what?)

See, in the Steel City we don't feel pity on you itsy bitsy
Gypsies (Nope) that feel pretty chill and heal quickly
And we deal midis and anything to get the cheese
We also got the haze if you tryna get skeed (Yeah)
But if you want the weed, needa talk to me
'Cause I be on my grind like some coffee beans (Yeah)
And we hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil, streets is lethal
Fiends with needles, lead the people, Nas came first, now read the sequel (Woo)
Should be illegal, but a legendary, all is secondary
More vocabulary than a dictionary (Yeah)
I'm a visionary, in time the world will be mine
Until then, I fill it with rhymes and leave it behind
Way behind 'til my state of mind is clearer
Lookin' at the cross hangin' on your rear-view mirror
'Cause mankind actin' pure and divine
So I proceed to MC 'til the world is mine

It was all about a dream
Turned into reality, double-cup of lean
Uh

[Verse 1]
Let me get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination
I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back
With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryin' to relax
Red wine up in my glass, plus Filet Mignon
I got a army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when everybody know me
Well, I made it big and everybody phony, ha
So could you pour me? I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mix in purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much?
Go 'head, judge me, hate cost money but this love free

[Chorus]
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine

What do you do when you think you could be a icon?
'Cause all these people get to screamin' when the lights on
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat
Racin' to the gate, but my flight gone
And now these writers takin' shots without a Nikon
But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though
Potion in my Sprite, then my night slows down, down (Aha)
See, that's exactly what I need
My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it was ""Donald Trump,"" a fuckin' hit but I just call it luck
They throw it on when I'm walkin' in the club
Hey, this some 'Burgh shit, I don't deserve this
Well, I don't think you lookin' far beyond the surface
Learn quick, now I'm big time
Fill your cup up, and I'ma sip mine

[Chorus]
Fill it up with dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine

Said, a place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide
I would've tried, but when I held that 9
All I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside of misery and poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I've survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't got a choice but to roll on
We finally find a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trickness
A spot where we can smoke in peace
Even though we G's, we still visualize places we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eyes, see this place where players go and pass it
Got a spot for us all, we can ball at thug's mansion

Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside

Sometimes I see the world for how messed up it really is
Tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it

Get a paycheck, spend it all on Polo

Personally I ain't nothin' but an average Joe though
And now I'm dressin' so expensive for no reason
Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezin'

So I leave a little paper there before I go

This a letter to whoever, I'm just hopin' that you see
Remember love and remember me

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
All of my homies used to get on my case like, ""When you 'bout to kill 'em?""
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprout some children
But I've been murderin' the game, I'm almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons (Pigeons)
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit, bro, would you give it all up for these nymphos?
I been broke, then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half-man and half-amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man (I'm an honest man)
My mama told me, ""Never put it on the lotto,"" and (And)
I work for everything I get, that is my motto, fam (My motto, fam)
So when I die, these bitches still can fuck my hologram ('Gram), goddamn

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that
 [Chorus: Mac Miller & Lil B]
(Time flies) Watch as time go
(Time flies) Time moves, time flows (Try to catch it)
(Time flies) How do we handle these things?
(Time flies) I am time (Try to catch it)
We are time and we have control
One thing we need to remember
Is that we are all in this together (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
You can expect the unexpected
These dreams I manifested from my head into reality
They seem a bit excessive, but I don't stress it
Two hands to count my blessings, all the times that I've been reckless
With a ego big as Texas, thinkin', ""I'm the man""
I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the crib small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk the path where only giants stand
I am the fireman, shit, I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone
On the road, even though I know they need me at home
Keep my control, from a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own, punches like this prolly beat up Stallone

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride (Yeah)
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that
 [Chorus: Mac Miller & Lil B]
(Time flies) One day, we will
(Time flies) We will find (Try to catch it)
(Time flies) We will conquer
(Time flies) Conquer with love (Try to catch it)
While time is on our side
Continue to hold to those beautiful memories
They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on

Ayo dipset in London, right up on the youtube
I don't know why it don't got two million two views
That's a great video, chilling in this city though
'bout to do a sold out show, like I'm Diddy though
But I'm not my first name Mac, and if you heard that
My first time in London, I came back
Cause this is freestyle off of the top
And when I rip it on the mic I said your jaw gonna drop
This some biggie, chilling here in this London city
Girls pretty, everything I never smoked ??
Only smoking on that haze you be smoking on that phase
I got bars for days, everybody amazed
Cause every way I'm spitting is crazy
Cats all be rapping on their ish but it doesn't even amaze me
I just saw Kanye and Jay-Z live in Watch The Throne
Gotta girl and I gotta bone
You got a phone, I got two though
Shout out to Future, I copped Pluto
That's a great album, all up on that track
And I flip it back with some gymnastics"

I wake up in my bed laying next to a naked woman whose name I forget
I live in a fictional unpredictable digital matrix
Lifted and faded, I been on vacation too long

Catch my second wind, hurricane, tornado is strong
Most of you just don't understand it but you playing along
I'm at the crib rolling up with WrestleMania on
Tracy McGrady with the long ball
Every night is crazy, neighbors angry, so the cops called
Got you stuck, car stalled
Danger with the lightsaber, motherfucking Darth Maul
You playing hard ball, don't mean to alarm y'all with the freshness

Yeah, history in the making
Bitter-sweet epiphanies (Get friendly with Satan)
Temptations too tempting
One man symphony, fresher than some Listerine
Been a beast, these rappers sweeter than a Krispy Kreme
Bars on guillotine, I'm a motherfucking wildebeest

I know that all the stars out, but I'm walkin' with my head down

Get faded like old photos, forget where I'm supposed to be
'Cause this one is for me

This goes out to me
It's my turn, finally
I stayed so quiet through it all
It's 'bout time I put a trophy on the wall

Girl, you look like trouble
I ain't tryna solve your puzzle
You better pick up your pieces, baby

You like me better when I'm sober (Don't ya?)
It's 3 in the mornin', tryna call you over (Won't ya?)

Just an excuse for education
Places that we can go from here
Just tell me when the road get clear

[Chorus]
Will you wait for me a little longer?
I promise I'ma be stronger now
I know that I've been gone a while, yeah

A little liquor gonna calm me down
You nothin' but trouble, trouble

Fake-ass bitch
Every word comin' out your mouth keep makin' me sick

Be a millionaire ‘fore the day over
Don't got a ride, so you stay over
Now you wanna fuck ‘cause you ain't sober
Fake-ass bitch
Everything you say is a lie, you can lay on this dick

You're so regular, pedestrian
I'm amazin', bitch, I've been blessed, man

Baby, baby, baby, yeah
I know, girl, girl, yeah, yeah, uh

[Verse]
I see you lookin' good, wearin' that T-shirt
And nothin' else but some purple panties
Your ass cheeks bouncin' off each other like they don't get along
But I'ma make 'em love each other
I'ma make them become the best of friends
Them ass cheeks, girl, them ass cheeks like twins
But which one was born first, baby?
Said, which one is older, and by how many minutes?
Girl, your ass cheeks got a mind of their own
Which one had better SAT scores, girl?
I don't know, I don't know
Baby, if your ass had a face
What expression would it be making when I put my tongue inside that asshole
And lick around like I'm tryna have some shitty soup?
Girl, fuckin' with you is like
Fuckin' with a girl with a nice ass, that's a lot of ass
And don't forget about them titties, girl
Don't forget about them nipples, no
They get hard when I rub 'em gently
And pinch 'em just a little bit
But I ain't tryna hurt you, girl
No, I don't wanna hurt you, girl
Unless you talkin' 'bout the way that your pussy gon' be hurtin' after I get done with it
Girl, I'm just tryna have some fun with it, oh
You ain't nothin' but a slutty-ass ho
Who fucks every rapper that comes to your city
But goddamn, you're so pretty
When that ass in leggings, girl
It don't matter the pattern, or if they just solid black
Oh, I want that ass, you've got that pack
I ain't talkin' 'bout no cellulite
I'ma tell you right, baby, we gon' have a swell night, ooh
And I don't know if you ever seen somethin' like me
When I pull out my dick, girl, I plan on fuckin' you so good, dang
I hope you like the way my dick feels
Put it in your mouth, girl
Don't you dare bite my shit 'cause I'll punch you in the motherfuckin' face
I'll hit a bitch, oh, I'll hit a bitch
But, you suck my dick good, then we can get along
Might even put the head in this song
Probably not, ooh, probably not
Girl, how does my dick taste after a show when I still haven't showered?
You suck on my balls, you a champion
Girl, you a champion, girl, baby, baby
You and me, nobody want us to be together, baby
But it's okay, I'ma fuck you anyway
And I heard that Kendrick fucked ya, I heard that Rocky fucked ya
I heard that every single rapper that been in your city this month fucked ya
But you still wouldn't fuck ScHoolboy Q and I feel ya
But, baby, you could love me right
And I know that your money tight
And I ain't gonna give you shit but a meal, a glass of Henny and this dick
Bitch, don't come at me for money, no
'Cause I'ma tell you you'se a ugly ho and slap you in the face
Punch you, give that ass a bloody nose
Ooh, I'm fuckin' crazy
And I wouldn't marry you if you fuckin' paid me a million dollars
'Cause you ain't shit but a real good pussy
And to be honest, that pussy ain't even that good
I just think it is because when you horny, everything seems incredible
You probably just a regular-ass bitch and I'm trippin'
Ooh, I'm on the road, girl, I'm trippin'
Missionary, doggystyle
Ride the dick, get wild, girl
From the side, do a split
Turn around, now suck my dick
Baby, suck my dick, oh
I love you, girl, sike
I just told your mama that
And then I fucked her too, while your daddy watched
I'm crazy, girl
Better workout, I don't like my bitches lazy, girl
Don't get lazy 'cause I'll kick your ass right to the curb
I know I'm gettin' fat, so are you down with that?
Ooh, baby, give that ass a slap, yeah, you like it, girl
And don't you try and put your tongue in my asshole 'cause that's way too nasty for me
And I ain't gay, but I like a girl to rub on my asshole when she sucks my dick
Is that weird? Maybe, girl
When I eat your pussy, can you feel my beard? It's crazy, girl
I'm a nasty motherfucker, in the Gap wearin' khakis, motherfucker
And don't you dare ask me for a rubber, 'cause I don't have those
Ayy, what the fuck's wrong?
Can I talk about your ass in a song?
Have you ever seen that ass in a thong?
Ooh, get low, baby, ooh, girl
I'll fuck you while I'm listenin' to Taylor Swift
Ooh, that's some player shit
See, at the end of the night, I might get you a Gatorade
'Cause, bitch, you need to catch your breath 'cause I just fucked the shit out of you
Ooh, I fucked the shit out of you
But don't you bleed on my sheets
Girl, you bled on my sheets
Now it's been red for a week
You bled on my sheets and stained them
My dreams been red for a week
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I just want you to know that you are not mine
Oh, yeah
I heard you fucked Justin Bieber
Let me tell you that's fine, ooh, baby, that's fine
But let me ask you one question, girl
Was his dick bigger than mine?
Don't tell me, ""Yes,"" I might get depressed
Oh, I'm walkin' in Rite Aid
And I see the milk section
What kind of milk do I get? Baby, what kind of milk do I get?
There's so many choices, so much variety of milk
I couldn't help but think of you
And all the things I want to do, oh, the milk section
Girl, me and you is like the milk section
But sometimes you need orange juice
And sometimes you need a little bit of both
But don't drink too much milk 'cause you'll be congested
Oh, and then somethin' manifested in my mind
I said, ""Hey, hey, cashier, you didn't give me the correct change""
And I can't deal with that right now
'Cause my mom gave me twenty dollars and said, ""Bring back my damn change""
You gon' make that lady go insane, yeah
You gon' make her lose her mind, oh, girl
I know what you like when you think of the perfect man
I bet you didn't think of me, and that's why I hate you, girl
But love is what we makin', girl
And you a little sloppy, naked girl
You might wanna tighten that up
'Cause ain't no famous celebrity gon' fuck you when you look like that
Oh, you gotta get good, start eatin' on the right track
And, baby, it's alright that
The first night, you let me pipe that
Never been with no white rapper, how was it?
Ooh, how was it, girl?
Was it everything you dreamed, or was it disappointin'?
Ooh, shit, that might need some ointment
Oh, girl, you ain't no ho, you just know what you want
And I got what you need, ooh, I got what you need
So, give that pussy to me
And I'ma do the right thing, I'ma do the white thing
And treat that pussy disrespectfully
Oh, your pussy don't get what it deserves
I'ma cum fast, it's cool, jack myself off, then I come back
Ooh, fuck that
Baby, I'll fuck you and I'll rap in your ear at the same time
Pick a song, I'm a jukebox, girl
And I can sing to you
You got some friends? Please bring 'em too
'Cause we could have a threesome
Sorry, I think I missed that note, I missed that note
Oh, let me tell you this story
Ooh, I was walkin' at the flea market the other day
And I saw half-price lamps
And that's good 'cause my living room lackin' some light
So, I bargained with the nice lady and said
""Can I get four for the price of three?
It's alright, you see? Just be nice to me""
And she said, ""Who the fuck you think I am?
This a 1970 vintage lamp, you can't find these anymore
Don't even sell them in stores""
That's how serious this dumb bitch was about her lamps
I said, ""I know your pussy is dry, but this dick gon' make it damp
Fuckin' tramp, that's what you are
So, bitch, put them lamps in my car
And I'ma go home, and I'ma watch late-night television""
Said, I'ma watch late-night television, girl
I can't pick between Leno or Letterman
Leno or Letterman? Leno or Letterman?
And I like Fallon too, and I like Kimmel too
And I like Craig Ferguson but I can't understand a single fuckin' word that he says, girl
All these words in my head, what happened to SNL?
It used to be so funny, and who the fuck is Fred Armisen?
Baby, baby, how'd he get that job?
But let me not spend no time hatin' on another man tryna get his
'Cause I'm just tryna get mine, and I'm gettin' off subject
Isn't this a love song? No
This is just a fuck song, woah
So that's what I'ma do, ooh, baby
Let me tell another story
Well, earlier today, I was flippin' through channels on the cable when I
When I came across one of those commercials for sick dogs, and I hate that shit
I hate eatin' a cheeseburger and watchin' a video about animal cruelty
'Cause I know that shit happens, but I like to forget it and enjoy my cheeseburger, yeah
'Cause I can't help but like it, girl
I know th—, I know they treat those cows like shit
And I ain't really with that, but I ain't no gay-ass vegetarian
I like beef, yeah, I like beef, oh, baby, I like beef, baby
Oh, let me tell you somethin' else
And I was on the internet the other day, did somethin' a little vain
I typed myself into Google verch, Google ver—, Google Search, 'scuse me
And what did I see? Oh, you ask me, what did I see?
I'll tell you right now, I saw some shit
I clicked on the first picture, and I enlarged it to full screen
And what did I see? You wanna know?
What I saw was so disgusting that I wanted to retire
I'ma tell you now what I saw, what I motherfuckin' saw
What did I see? I had something stuck in my teeth
I think it's lettuce, girl
From that turkey burger I ate when I was out at Turkey World
Oh, baby, I'll do you like some jerky, girl
Nah, nah, fuck that, suck my motherfuckin' dick
I don't play around, I'ma take this dick, I'ma lay it down, oh
Yo, I'm not gay, I love pussy
Ooh, I dream of pussy, I draw pussy
I write about pussy like it is some type of false idol
It really is, 'cause y'all be prayin' on that pussy
Y'all be worshippin' that pussy
Y'all be on Instagram, commenting bitches' pictures
You thirsty for that pussy, and I ain't really with that
Oh, I ain't with that, girl, yeah, yeah
Would you fuck me?
Would you fuck me if I looked more like Channing Tatum?
Is that the type of guy you like?

Why you wanna see me now?
Is it because I'm on TV now? Yeah
My haters wish they could be me now
Thank the Lord the tables turned
'Cause now it's my turn

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
When I used to be dirt broke, I couldn't afford to get a Happy Meal (Yeah)
Now it's steak and lobster, that's a make-a-player-happy meal (Yeah)
But back then, you were lookin' at me and laughin' tears (Hahaha)
Now I'm rich and you steady tryna get yo' ass up in here (Woo)
Tell me why I couldn't get a ride when I needed one
Now it's so many cars, it's like I never needed one
Allergic to bitch niggas, never see me with one
Want deeper life until Jesus Christ and his kingdom come
The same musty ass egghead sixth grader
Y'all were laughin', but he knew later, shit would get greater (Yeah)
From broke as a joke, now he's earnin' as much as six Lakers (Fire)
Save yourself, bitch, I'm savin' this paper (Haha)
I turned that green and trappin' into that black Bentley ballin' money
Always got at least fifteen stacks with me
And you can ride as long as you ain't got your hand out
Soon as you ask for somethin', that's when you get yo' ass out

Had to kill myself to be here, was it all worth it?
Spent a lot of lonely nights contemplating purpose
Only did it 'cause I'm white, do I still deserve it?
Hell yeah
I put a lot of work in, thank the Lord he blessed me
First time in Houston, Bun took me to Frenchy's
I'll put a couple albums out, then they'll all forget me
But a gangster gon' always be a gangster, boy
And you don't know my past, you weren't right there wit' me
Hittin' licks to get some cash, just to buy some hash
I'm a rottweiler, top dollar, Babe Ruth, shot caller
Grand slam, head of the table, I'm the Godfather
Burn it to the ground, pickin' up the pieces
You can't save yourself when the beast is off the leashes
'Cause we comin' for you
Yeah, we comin' for you

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul, Mac Miller, Ab-Soul]
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish

Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Let's have some fun)
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul & Mac Miller]
In my lifetime, my whole M.O. was to get this M-O-N-E-Y
Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor (Soul)
Long story short, that's one of my long-term goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swang like Pootie Tang (Uh)
I done seen some spooky things through these Gucci shades
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade (I have a dream)
But can't we all just get along? (That one day)
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day
She say, ""Soulo, you so crazy and deranged"", I say, ""I know""
Roll that weed, nigga (Shake that ass, ho)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
In this lifetime, be the time of your life
It's been a while but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike (Alright, alright)
And as a child, I was curious, my mind was the dirtiest (Uh-huh)
Curse words was probably my first words (Affirmative) (God damn)
My home run derby shit (Derby shit), was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest minds will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to right my wrongs, the days short, the nights is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish in gigantic portions
Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion, divide and conquer
Walk on water, won't be long 'til I'm flyin', that's my departure (Jesus)
I'm a goner
Shoot you down from the sky with eyes of a archer (Ah, yeah)
Better find that thing you die for (Ah, yeah)
(I don't know what I get so high for) (Ah, yeah)
I'm a problem and as hard as I try, no hidin' from karma
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes
There was a time

The underdog, like to play the game with Diddy Kong
She the god type, throw that bitch a Klondike
Everything is alright, see it's written in the Psalms
I told her I get rich off my little songs
Gave her a million reasons that she should come along
Immediately, she dropped her shit
But everywhere I go, they told me, ""Watch yo' bitch""
(Goddamn) I guess I got another one
Good vibrations, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch
I put the gourmet flavors inside the honey blunt

Got me rollin' in a circle, top-down, blowin' purple

Hop in the whip and laugh, I got some piff to grab
Then go and scoop TreeJay, then sit and pass around the weed
While we talk about life and all the different ways to get rich overnight
Shit, I think I'ma be a billionaire
But, this life here ain't really fair
I try to do my own thing, be a little different
See, I'm just tryin' to spit about this life that I'm livin'
And if it was a game, I be playin' extra innings
Never be the same, tryin' to find out where I fit in, uh
I'm in the sky, but I haven't found a limit
So I'ma keep risin' for another couple minutes
Until I reach maximum altitude, Himalayan mountain view
I get refreshed without a Mountain Dew
They wonder 'bout this Malcolm dude
Oh, that's just my government name
No Republican, you never see me runnin' with lames
I got the Most Dope with me from city to city
Lookin' for a spot to get tipsy
Carry music that I hustle like Nipsey
The type of bars puttin' stones in your kidney
I think I found my passion
Used to play sports, now all I play is Madden
Hey, I used to hoop like Okafor
Now there's Henny bottles where all of my trophies were
Divorced from the norm, married to the speaker
If you don't know me, it's nice to meet ya
 [Interlude]
Haha, yeah
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

[Verse 2]
It was all a dream, I used to read Vibe magazine
Picture myself right on the cover lookin' clean
With some size thirty jeans and a medium tee
You ain't fresh 'til it fit right, get like me
See, he never tried to be a G
Tricks is for kids, got 'em hidden in my sleeve
Which cover my tattoos, oh yeah, Script shit
While this Earth stay spinnin' like a kickflip
A misfit in this clique-filled world
Groupies tryin' to holla while I'm chillin' with my girl
'Cause I'm all that, ha, no Nickelodeon
Address the class when I'm standin' at the podium
They don't believe me, guess I'm the only one
See, this path gets slippery, petroleum jelly
Sittin' by the tele', watchin' movies
I be up in the air, no George Clooney
Killin' 'em softly with The Fugees
Walkin' in the party like I own the place, ""Who's he?""
Somebody answer that, you see them stand and clap
The boy got presents like Santa's bag, haha
 [Outro]
We just some motherfuckin' kids
We just some motherfuckin' kids
Tryna get it how we live, do it big
Just some motherfuckin' kids

Tryna do it big, get it how we live

I bet it must be nice, chillin' every day
Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank
I'm workin' all the time, never gettin' me a break
But fuck it, that's fine, not a minute go to waste
I just wanna be a legend, every second I gotta be goin' in
A part of me wanna chill, but a part of me wanna win
No college payin' my bills, I'm sayin' just what I feel
'Cause haters be lookin' stupid, when you just keepin' it real
I got too much on my mind, to care about the internet bullshit
Or them people comin' up say I'm forgettin' who I am
Just because they random dudes I went to school with
I'm cool with chillin' with some buddha smoke
I always do it big like a Jewish nose
Cadillacs, I'm tryna get a few of those

Do you believe in fairytales, dreams come true?
One day, you gon' make it
If they gave you a handout and you were down bad, would you take it?
I found that bein' famous in reality, well, it ain't shit
'Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
But it don't mean a thing 'til you change it
Listen, baby, I'ma be great now
We can watch a movie, fuck and stay up late
I'ma make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young, they told me to wait until I'm older
They turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for the free
""Hey, Mac, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?""
Bitch, suck my dick

Go to Africa, then come back wearin' jackal fur (Whoa)

Stop, somebody get that man a pacifier
Y'all ain't shit but the appetizer (No)

When I die, told her snort my ashes, that's a dead line

Life's meaning tends to tie the open mind in knots
If it's all a game, I'm at the final boss (Bow)

And if the rain is just the cryin' gods, then Utopia's behind the fog

And Mr. Drummond's wife is somewhere smokin' meth on the ship deck?
We livin' in a shipwreck, we nothin' but some insects
Obsessed with sex in this business givin' big checks (Ching)
Been ready to die until I realized I haven't lived yet
I haven't made an indent to the Lord we try to impress (Praise God)
I just wish that I was fearless, bikin' down the mountain
Start to tremble as the gears switch (Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit)
So hear this, hear this, come bathe in my appearance (Ya)
When life give you a car, learn to steer it before you crash
There's more than cash and there's more than ass (Ass)
'Cause all those pleasures turn to torture fast (Fast)
And you can try to fight it but you never win (No)
They assemblin' the evidence to keep you from the truth and the lies (Lies)
We fall into the glamour like a cancer

The other day while I was on my break to smoke cigarettes
I hit her up, she had some weed and told me, ""Come through, we should smoke
Bring a pair of lungs, don't bring no money, baby, I ain't broke""
So I'm walkin' up the stairs to the porch
Knocked against the door, heard some feet against the floor
The door had opened up and it was her
She told me, ""Hurry, come right in
Leave your shoes up by the front, 'cause we just put new carpets in""
She asked me 'bout my day, then sat me down
Told me, ""We should have some fun, there ain't nobody around""
She got this crazy pill the other day when she was on her way to work
Told me it would make my problems go away and fix the hurt
That I had, well, that don't sound bad
Down the hatch, kinda nervous, ""Just relax,"" she said rubbin' on my back
Well, I ain't really into drugs, but fuck it
I'ma take a trip and I'ma love it (Love it)

But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, back

I left right after that and started drivin' to my house where I reside
I was high and possibly a little fuckin' out my mind
Can't remember where I live, it ain't like I just bought this house
I said, ""Fuck it,"" took a breath, opened my door and just jumped out
And it's funny 'cause I didn't even hit against the road
I just went right through the ground and started floatin' on my own
I see colors, different colors like they glowin' and they're light
They was glowin' like they glowin' in the dark, but it was bright
That's alright, this shit crazy, what the fuck she had me take?
If this kill me, I'ma come back, haunt her every single day
As I wait, sittin' somewhere that I never seen
Feel like I forever dream, just imagine, set a scene
Power and imagination got all my surroundings changin'
Found a place to drown my brain in somethin' like it's outer space
But nothin' like the pictures from the astronauts
They showed me back at school
When they told me drugs were bad, oh man, oh man, they had me fooled

While these groupie hoes run and try to hunt me down
Now every day feelin' like the best day ever
Heard it's a long road, but it get way better
A little money in my pocket, but my eyes on a million
Got these doubters listenin', surprised when they feel him
Ballin' like Jordan, you ballin' like Wilson
Feelin' like a kid again, chillin' watchin' Gilligan

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night

They tell me I'm the shit, I'm like, duh?
Girls on my dick, I'm like, duh?
Gettin' stupid in this bitch, so wassup?
Wake the whole damn world, homie, I don't give a fuck
Young, rich, and famous, thanks for askin', how are you?
Party every night, that's exactly what I do
Gettin' stupid in this bitch, so wassup?
Wake the whole damn world, homie, I don't give a fuck
Wake up, up-up-up-up

Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up

[Verse 2]
Hey, hear the alarm, time to start the day
Rub my eyes, light some weed, send my mind on its way
I'm gone, somewhere to my own dimension
I, show these hoes no affection
Just party every night, gettin' so demented
At that time, I'm lookin' in the mirror, seein' no reflection
Got me wonderin', why don't they get it?
Spend the night with me, I'm sure you won't regret it
Got some liquor on the way, the weed is twistin', you should stay
You still listen when they say the kid is spittin', gettin' paid
But my differences in age got me shittin' with a rage
'Cause what's written on the page straight sicker than some AIDS
I came to get fucked up (Fucked up), I, I came to act wild (Wild)
You, you came to prepare for the future, I live for right now (Now)
 [Pre-Chorus]
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night

They tell me I'm the shit, I'm like, duh?

Welcome to reality
It's either this or your fatality
I am gravity, I am your majesty
I'm the truth and that's a reason that you mad at me
I'm the source of all your power, I'm your battery
I can either be the end or be your masterpiece
I can either be a friend or be a casualty
I am your addiction, you are attached to me
You try to run away, but always comin' back to me
Good and evil, I am duality
I'm the creator, I am God inside his factory
I'm blasphemy, I'm standin' on the edge
And there ain't a place I'd rather be
Yeah, you have a dream, you have a dream
But if you not ready to wake up, then go back to sleep
Open up your eyes, yeah, you have to see
Fuck rulin' the world, I want the galaxy

It's not official news here, as far as I'm concerned it didn't happen, you shut your mouth

Three times

Raps millenniums (Okay)

It's the same me, just a couple new developments (It's me)

They sellin' us our dreams
And we couldn't buy 'em back if they were sellin' 'em for free (Cha-ching)
I speak for the diseased and the misunderstood

I push the Beamer and the Benz, about to cop the Bentley (Bentley)
Fuck your feelings and your friends, you will not correct me (No)
I do this shit correctly, leave a murder scene messy
Dancin' with two lefties, screamin' fuckin' Elvis Presley (Okay)
What do you do when you want to get high
So you call up your connect, your connect tell you he's dry
It's time to quarantine, thinkin' you for sure a fiend
Now your pleasant dreams start to morph into a horror scene (No)

Hit the zoo, see the lion cage and have an orgy
Drink WD-40, tell a bunch of stories about the make-believe glory (Uh)

It's that back-ally bum fight, make sure you sittin' up right
Aristocratic pussy, ring her bell, then she cum twice

Just a couple words from my mortal soul (Mortal soul)
Time travel, tryin' to get back but the portal closed (Portal closed)
All-terrain game, bitch, I'm durable (Yeah)
Mr. Drifter, everything is portable (Let's go)
I'm playin' dominoes with the common folk (Hello)
Lose a hundred dollars quickly, guess that's all she wrote (Hello)
And everybody got their pot of gold (Uh-huh)

Start to understand, we are not alone (Nope)

Shit gets real, then you gotta go (Okay)

You wanna get up to me, the game needs me
I be ya bitch like a beat says, ""Please me""
So I don't even know, but I keep on teasing
I just keep on doin' it, it's a Point Breeze thing
I'ma about to do it, it's the trees bring-brought
And you's about to get shot
'Cause my shit is lyrical, it gets sent to you like spiritual
If you wanna do it, I'm a kid in school
Just tryna hit the bull, this shit is so typical, it's pitiful
Shittin' on this chick 'cause I'm hittin' you
I'ma hit you back with some shit, as a matter of fact
Nobody can say what I can say, nobody can do that
So I can do that, baby, screw cats
And I'm about to do it, baby, yeah, I knew that
And if you wanna come and get into the room back
I'ma come to you dressed in black, that is how I act
So if you wanna come, you can't even see me or be me
Malcolm McCormick is on the CD, it's so easy
And matter fact, it's Easy Mac
Got some good tree or weed, give me four Gs of that
Maybe a little more, get maybe a quarter

I'm killin' more lames, I'm gettin' more chains
You think you is makin' it pour, I'm makin' more rain
And if you wanna do it clean like the cocaine or propane
When I explode, you know I know things
'Cause I have wisdom, it's a lyrical prisdom
And if you wanna know 'cause I hit him, I ain't with him
If he did that on Saturday night
I can't tell you shit, you ain't fuckin' askin' me right
You is just investigatin', debatin' if I was doin' shit
Screw you, bitch, I'm about to do it 'cause you knew the shit
I was right here, that's my fuckin' alibi
You can't do it 'cause you know I'll make the battle-cry
When I come back, I gotta battle rap
Askin' me questions, homie, I'ma battle grap—battle back
That's what I meant to say
But if you think I was serious, I meant to play
So if you wanna make me confuse you or use you
Like a drug, I abuse you, it's what the Jews do
I don't really care, true, boo, word
I don't know 'cause it's the same shit ya heard
Before the shit was word, before the shit float
I do this shit, keep it warm like a coat

Beedie shot ya, whatcha gon' do? Heatie pops ya

Pop of a Glock, that's the sound when I drop ya
Stuff your body parts in a locker
Runnin' from the cops, Willy Parker
And I ain't gonna walk on your set that you rep
'Cause your set full of talkers, straight snitches
I'll punch you in your face, leave you with eight stitches
Bitches, I play viscous

Title is inevitable, I'm incredible
Got lames hidin' behind frames like I was federal
The fuckin' general, suck up on my genitals
My flow's outta this world like I got some tentacles
I'm with the pencil to murder instrumentals
I'm spittin' ammunition, you better listen to potential
I'm fifteen years old with no restrictions on the mental
My mind flows as I go, I follow where I'm sent to

Or freestylin' on some ill, that's excitement
Keep a fat sack and the gat at the side of him
In case ya snakes try to take what I'm hidin' in
I spit it slick, so sick, need a vitamin

Aim it at ya forehead, leavin' four dead
Bust in the door with lead and whores spread
I'm a warhead, lookin' for more head
Fuckin' on the floor 'til I got a sore head
Pussy lips drippin', stingin' like a hornet
Kickin' bitches out the door in the mornin'

Rappers tryna spit it but they shit is corny
I ain't even wit' it, man, for real

[Verse 4: Easy Mac]
I'm not the best at school but I'm set for college
'Cause when the bitch give me brains, yo, I get some knowledge
I keep a few close friends and the rest will tarnish
A few respectable rappers, the rest are garbage

I make it rain harder, game remain slaughter
My brain remains smarter and you stay retarded
You better add another name to today's departed

I never wake up and lose my skill
I get baked up and use 'em, ill
The music real and every day I be movin' bills
Makin' cake, hatin' jakes, puttin' dudes in jail

And I'll tell you what they say right before they arrest you
""Anything you say can and will be used against you""
And even though they got no reason to resent you
They treat you like you got a set of criminal credentials
Me and B.DuBB are here to murder the game
We gon' spit off every minute 'til you heard of the name
We kickin' it exquisite, sittin' and gettin' lifted
Bangin' music 'til the neighbor's pissed and I'm evicted

https://genius.com/Mac-miller-watch-movies-with-the-sound-off-review-lyrics,"Before I start and jump into this review I want to inform you that I wasn't a Mac Miller fan before this album dropped. Mac Miller while being one of the most successful indie hip hop artists ever, lyrically he just didn't do it for me. He just kind of reminded me of everything I wasn't really feeling about mainstream hip hop these days. Then about a month or so before the release of his sophomore effort “Watching Movies With the Sound Off” he released a couple joints before that. My ears didn't really perk up to listen until I heard “The End Is Near” first because Ab-Soul is on it, second Mac produced the joint and thirdly lyrically Mac Miller had stepped his game up. I wasn't entirely sold but I was intrigued. Next day the video for “S.D.S” came out produced by FlyLo. Mac Miller once again came correct. Lastly I saw the tracklisting and guest features on this album and I knew I had to cop it. Let's see if “WMWTSO” was enough to transform me into a fan

As I stated before I wasn't too keen on Mac Miller's catalog before this, however once this album starts it immediately grabbed my attention from the beat and the dark lyrics. “The Star Room” is the first track on the album and it's filled with a Mac reflecting on his life and how it's changing. His new found success isn't all glory, glamour and fun times and it's evident this is causing him frustration. Everything from love, to drugs is covered in this song and it's a breathe of fresh air to hear from him

A couple tracks later we get “I Am Not Real” which features Earl Sweatshirt (unfortunately only in the form of a hook) but the darkness continues on this joint. Like in “The Star Room” Mac Miller talks about more specifically about the all the bad sides about the fame that he's garnered over the years. Gold diggers, fake friends considered acquaintances, pain, drugs and more. Hearing Mac take us into the other not so glamorous side of the music business. Mac is searching for answers to a lot of questions in this album in general and he's bringing us along for his journey through life

“I Am Who I Am (Killing Time)” has Mac Miller questioning being famous but this also questioning God and religion. He feels like God has blessed by becoming famous however at the same time he wonders why God gave it to him if he's sinning. He questions those who judge him for buying material things with the money that he's making now. He feels that he almost wasting away in the studio because he spends so much time in there. The second verse takes an even darker turn with the content

Forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealing with death like you work in the morgue aborsving the souls
Forgotten, he lost his way
Starring down that barrel, thinking not today

Now I'll be honest the middle of the album kind of falls off a little bit for me because he seemingly goes back to the old Mac Miller that I wasn't a fan off. With songs like “Red Dot Music” (with Action Bronson), “Gees” (with ScHoolboy Q) and “Watching Movies” old fans of Mac will be pleased to see that he is in original form here and I think that's a good thing for fans to see. There's definitely maturity on this album but he sticks to his roots too

“REMember” is one of my favorite songs on the record where Mac Miller is paying homage to a fallen friend. The first verse has him talking to his friend wishing he would come back. A strong line has Mac wishing his friend had a kid so Mac could tell him/her stories about their would be father. The second first has Mac Miller telling people not to take life for granted because it can be taken from you at any moment so cherish it

The questioning of all of life's most difficult questions continues with “Aquarium”. The first verse mostly is about religion and his wanting to search for a deeper purpose in his life than what he's managing now:

""I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings”

The second verse is the continued questioning on life's purpose and even brings the idea that in America it almost seems like our purpose is to make money and gaining knowledge. Throughout the entire record we're witnessing a 21 year old man question the world around him from everything he's given, to everything he's earned over the years
“WMWTSO” is easily Mac Miller's best effort. One part that I skipped on the album was its production which was extremely solid. One part that I see being overlooked is how well Larry Fisherman's (aka Mac Miller) beats were on this album. This album shows that he's really put in the work on the production side of his game. Even as a whole the guest producers on the album were solid and created a cohesive sounding album (the only beat I thought that didn't really fit in was “S.D.S” but even that doesn't matter because the beat was straight fire). Lyrically Mac Miller puts everything on the line, he's questioning a lot of things and dealing with a lot of pain too

For fans of Mac Miller you might not like the change his underwent as of late, but assuming that you're fans of anyone that's featured on the project you should enjoy what Mac Miller is offering with “WMWTSO”. All the features are on point and the diversity on this project whether it be production or lyrics is good to hear from him. I am officially a Mac Miller fan, “Born Sinner” and “Yeezus” may have come out on the same day but don't sleep on this album. What ever box you had Mac Miller in before this release I can guarantee you that he breaks that box wide open during this entire album"

Slow down before eveything change
24/7, I say, ""Things are lookin' up""
But I could be drunk, I just—

Yeah, and fall, and fall

Down, down, down, down

Uh, lovin' you is takin' its toll

And watch the sun come up

She  chase a high that she'll never reach

Nobody ever notice that she don't talk at all (Talk at all)

If you got somethin' to match

Baby, you could wear my hat, just twist it to the back
We drinkin' out the bottle while you sittin' on my lap
Then we could go outside, let me take you on a ride
With the top down, show you off to people, you my prize
Nothin' like a girl who likes to wear a pair of Nikes
Shinin' like my high beams, cooler than some iced tea
Yeah, I got a female who like to send some pictures to my email
Professional with shoppin', you would think she worked in retail
Snapbacks make 'em look so cute
And that girl know how to blow somethin' like she play the flute, ha
That long hair, and it's fallin' down her back
I put on my hat, and she reach and tryna snatch it
Baby, you be hotter than a match stick, bad bitch
Make a snapback look fantastic, but sorry, you can't have this

She like to play those stupid games with me
She never seem to have enough
She brought some friends for whoever came with me
So, my homies sayin' that's what's up
And I hear her name's pretty, from different continent
Tellin' me she single, but to tell the truth, I'm not convinced
It's all good, I'm used to boyfriends always talkin' shit
Thinkin' that they players, but I'm coachin', call me Popovich
Baby, I ain't doctor rich, but I'll probably show you a good night
When girls come out with me, they make sure that they look right
She used to be so grounded, all the sudden she took flight
And we ain't seen her since, so tell me, what does that look like?
I'm the type to bring you right back down to Earth
And for what it's worth, I'll put that Louis on your purse
She like to wear my hat, make me laugh, so I'm guessin' she a keeper
I think she stole it though, I keep tryin' to reach her

Baby, you could wear my hat (Call me back)
Just make sure you give it back (Hahaha)

In Nashville, the president tried to keep up the pressure
There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that says, ""Fool me once, shame on... shame on you. You fool me— can't get fooled again""

[Verse 1]
What's the matter, all your guns have a cold?
'Cause y'all be lettin' bullets run out like you blowin' your nose
You just a Joe in some clothes, allowin' homes to explode
Family of four hits the floor with their bones on the road
I ain't hatin' on your duty, y'all some soldiers of war
Kids dyin' in the street, don't even know there's a war
You've heard it before, victims hidden by the president
Invadin' countries for some weapons, missin' all the evidence
Imprison the prisoners, listen to parishioners
Look at yourself, takin' orders from your minister
Mind-locked, you's a P.O.W
Ain't a real man if every death doesn't trouble you
George W., you just not learnin'
Brainwashed by the sermon, thought you heard certain
One in a dozen, my cousin didn't have a choice
Wanted to go home, but they didn't let him have a voice
Say it was right, wanted to make him a wife
But the evil, lethal people already takin' his life
So if ya takin' a stand, make sure that you can
And don't ever speak if you're not raisin' your hand
The life he made for his son, savin' his funds
Dreamin' 'bout the doctor, lawyer that one day he'd become
But too busy playin' with guns, they say it was dumb
How you supposed to hide when you got nowhere to run?
It's a shame 'cause Nick would've been a great father
Why bother the same slaughter to praise Allah?
I oughta celebrate my cousin's memory
But who deserves a penalty in a fight without an enemy?
 [Chorus]
We brothers in arms, we can't give a hand
I can't sit back, let it happen, livin' to stand
Takin' it on as my personal mission
Try and yell for help, but ain't nobody listen

[Verse 2]
Kids dream about just bein' some thugs
But they just shrug when you ask 'em if they busted a slug
And now you dropped out of school 'cause you thought it was cool
Forgot that your crew never even shot at a dude
When you cocked up the Uzi, now you locked up in juvie
Tryna imitate the gangster that you saw in the movies
Your act didn't fool me, you're still just a goonie
Tryna pull that, if I don't move, you're gonna shoot me
Go ahead, do me in if that's how it has to happen
'Cause I'ma keep rappin' when the people stop clappin'
Stop askin' 'cause I'm hatin', not lovin'
You're nothin' if you're willin' to shoot down your own brethren
I ain't tryna act like a modern prophet
I don't even give charity money out my pocket
The Glock? Nah, never cocked it
So drop it, haters need to stop it
Words seek your brain like a heat-seekin' rocket
I talk the talk as well as walk it
I speak from the heart, haters just mock it
Tryna reunite people like Pac did
God, is there a chance that you're there?
If you're listenin', will you please answer my prayers?
I know it's been a while since our last conversation
I think Satan's been givin' me temptation
It's your vocation to give me salvation
So please, can you help me with my current situation?
Since creation, my orientation
I've had the information, given inspiration
When can I expect the next resurrection?
I'm lookin' in the mirror, not seein' a reflection
So if you see Easy Mac, bless him
'Cause he's in need of protection
 [Chorus]
We brothers in arms, but we can't give a hand
I can't sit back, let it happen, livin' to stand
Takin' it on as my personal mission
Try and yell for help, but ain't nobody listen
We brothers in arms, but we can't give a hand
I can't sit back, let it happen, livin' to stand
Takin' it on as my personal mission
Try and yell for help, but ain't nobody listen

My bitch can tell that I'm addicted to pussy, she lookin' past it
The smile that she fakin' is tragic, hate lookin' at it
That magic, I try to grasp it, she's had it with the dramatics
Fantasize of love, so classic
Attracted to what she got up in her attic, can we mind fuck?
Do I lie when I look inside her eyes? Hush, don't say a word
I know I make you hurt, sorry is my favorite word
I don't deserve your trust, but can we make it work?
I hate to end the story, can we wait until the morning to decide on it?
Spend this time pretendin' it was that first summer
We was pure lovers
She was used to bein' hurt, I took that curse from her
Sometimes I wonder what it's all for, you wish that I would call more
You're sick of seein' condoms in my sock drawer
Love turns to war so quickly, I envisioned us married and fifty
Couple of kids that we drop off at little league

Yeah, um
And I see you fallin' victim to the thirst
All the sins you committed, you could prolly use a couple minutes in church
But, for what it's worth, I think you're perfect
There's an angel hidin' underneath your surface
Yeah, the woman of my dreams, I'm lookin' at her sleep
The pussy right in front of me, I shouldn't be so weak
What did I do to deserve a love like this?
You see her shinin'? That's my sunlight, bitch
I'm sick of fightin', that smile is so invitin'
I see you every time I'm writin'
I'm losin' to all my vices, they kickin' my ass
I hold on to this feelin', I wish it would last
Don't wanna lose you for some evil I did in the past
You knew I fucked that bitch and you didn't react?
Girl, it's me and you, how simple is that?
You gave me all your love, now I'm givin' it back
But I know that
 [Chorus]
Girl, you the worst, yeah
You know that you the worst
But I'm somethin' you can't lose
If you just told me the truth, that'd be a first, but

Save this for later on, this gon' be our wedding song
 [Verse 2]
We fuckin' up a storm, gon' start rainin' on my honeymoon
I'm so in love with you, wish there was a substitute
For that word, 'cause that word don't explain my feelin'
Its meanin' is demeanin' to the girl of which I've been dreamin' 'bout
Love it when I eat you out, girl, I just can't sleep without you
Let you know everything I think about you
Close your eyes, be free, that's really all I'm 'bout
Never disrespect me and I'll never have to lock you out
That was just a joke, you're so cute when you get mad at me
You're so fun to play with, you'da thought you came with batteries
Loves her fashion magazines, circle what she like
Leanin' on my shoulder, she the purple with my Sprite, right?

[Chorus]
W-w-will you fuck me all the time? 'Cause I need a freak
Let me, let me get inside your mind, you don't need to speak
Save this for later on, this gon' be our wedding song
Save this for later on, this gon' be our wedding song
If-if-if I call you on the phone, would you touch yourself?
Is that enough to make you not fuck with somebody else?
Save this for later on, this gon' be our wedding song
Save this for later on, this gon' be our wedding song

[Bridge]
Baby, I know sometimes I don't always say the right things (This gon' be our wedding song)
But I hope you always know (This gon' be our wedding song)
I'll definitely treat that pussy right at all times
There's not a second I do not treat the pussy right (This gon' be our wedding song)
So, I'll-I'll make sure the rest of my game catches up with my pussy game, you feel me?
Let's go
 [Chorus]
W-w-will you fuck me all the time? 'Cause I need a freak
Let me, let me get inside your mind, you don't need to speak
Save this for later on, this gon' be our wedding song
Save this for later on, this gon' be our wedding song

Ain't shit you can tell me now, fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch, you jealous now, smokin' weed at the crib watchin' Belly now (Alright)

And all the time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy
In God's desire, I make water wine, pausin' time, it's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the T's and dot the I's, wonderin', well
Wonderin' how I got this high, fell asleep and forgot to die, Goddamn
I'm poppin' them downers and drinkin' them powders, faded

Um

[Verse 1]
Well, this is for the title, this is my recital
This is checkin' my vitals, makin' sure I got a pulse
Swear the world is turnin' into shit, it's probably my fault
But, I built a bridge before I ever built a wall
I got too many problems and I just can't call it
Open up my eyes, but I'm still unconscious
Throw me a surprise, and don't lie, be honest
Keep your fingers crossed as I bring the sauce
I ain't no bitch, I ain't no motherfuckin' fraud
Shit, I'm gettin' higher, tryna cut it up with God
Hungry in the jungle and my stomach always rumble
So I'm huntin' 'til I'm comin' back with somethin' for the squad
Let me take my time, let me break shit down
I never get ahead of myself, I get around
Assume that I'm too much, room like a new truck
Never gave two fucks, sky, how I boost up
Oops, did I lose ya?
These maneuvers make you students, I school ya
Sorry if it's rude, but this food gettin' chewed up
April don't fool us, very bad crew cuts
Screwed up medulla, I silver spoon ya
Witches need brooms, I consume ya
Illuminate the room, full moon, nothin' less (Yes)
Who needs stress? This about as good as it gets, shit
 [Chorus]
Mermaids keep swimmin'
Deep in this well that I'm wishin'
I can never tell the difference
Between what is and what isn't
So, 'til the clock stop tickin' (Ride, ride)
'Til there's no food in the kitchen
I get to livin' good

Give you what you need

Let me give you what you need

Well, fighter jets keep fallin'
Floatin' on the ground, tell 'em, ""Get back,"" caution
Never come around that often, I find that problematic
Ain't fuckin' with your rotten asses, shit, blossom to an evergreen
Mhm, the view up here is heavenly, mhm
You be fragile, I don't travel with the cattle
No, I'd rather go above beyond to better things, yeah
And I keep ridin', they keep sellin', but I ain't buyin'
Why be grounded when I be flyin'?
You come 'round this, you may be blinded 'cause we be shinin', diamonds
A puzzle you can put your mind in, a lot of trouble always find that I'm in
But if I fall, I'ma come back climbin'
So, don't show me no love, don't try and act familiar 'cause you ain't familiar
I been on my J-O-B, tryna stay low-key
If the name ain't Miller, we don't feel you

Mermaids keep swimmin'
Deep in this well that I'm wishin'

[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
Man, I think I'm Eric Andre
Man, I think I'm Louis C.K.
Man, I think so therefore I am, man, It's 8 a.m.
Man, my mind is an emporium of cute naked hoes
My brother one of the only ones I can confide in
It ain't no water in the pool, go 'head and dive in (Dive in)
I toot my horn, I blow my bugle, I recycle
I say, ""Free beluga whales"" on YouTube, what do you do?

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Okay
The pussy like trouble 'cause I'm in it often
A drug habit like Philip Hoffman will probably put me in a coffin
But down the slope in my toboggan
Three day delirium, gettin' weirder than Austin
Now it's 7 in the morning, this rapper life is so boring
Still at it, the drug absorbent, endorphin addict, yeah
The evil follow me, I got a devil magnet
I know a bitch who'll let you fuck her for Coachella passes

[Verse 3: Sir Michael Rocks]
Oh, so pompous, the ambiance
You remind me of the lobby of the Mondrian
I saw you meditatin', get your Gandhi on
If she got that stank puss, then I won't be long
 [Verse 4: Mac Miller]
Never lose your mind 'cause insanity is brutal
Life is just like college, all you have's your noodle
Mirror mirror on the wall, I'm staring at a dead man
Me and Mikey go back like Bron-Bron's headbands
The white American, hiding from the Aryan

[Verse 5: Sir Michael Rocks]
New Tibetan Mastiff, and he hate it when you stare at 'im
Jump in, the jacuzzi on (Yeah,) say I fuck witchu the long way
I love you more than Kanye love Kanye (And I'm a)

[Verse 6: Mac Miller]
Slave to the W, I don't hang with losers
I'm in the suburbs doin' drive-by's on Razor scooters
It's my first try, swear I got a third eye
It's work time, I sell the coke to students out in Irvine

[Verse 7: Sir Michael Rocks]
Eh, coming off the high, listening to Jamiroquai
Why we go through hell when we tryna get to paradise?
It's like we ain't scared of death but we scared of life
It's like we shootin' for the stars but we scared of heights

[Verse 8: Mac Miller]
I'm in-doors, pair of gym shorts, with the Sith Lord
We might go bowling later, maybe play Connect 4
Get high, fuck her with the Tech Deck
Callin' local middle schools and send in some death threats
 [Interlude: Sir Michael Rocks]
Hey, look
When I tell you this, I mean this seriously, from the bottom of my heart
I need the briefcase in fifteen minutes
Or everybody's finished

I love my powder white, prefer my bitches black
I'm gettin' lit with Da$h, you don't see us in the back
No longer little Mac, a briefcase with a million cash
Oh, yeah

What if I gotta stop rappin'?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

What if I never get the chance tell the world what I gotta say?
And when I die, all I do is just ride away
I try and talk about my life in every song
So you have a little somethin' to remember when I'm gone
I tell it like it is, I ain't pretendin' that I'm on
But I tell you that I'm workin' and I'm gettin' very strong
It won't be long 'til you hear me on the radio
But in my head, I got a ways to go
But I'ma take it slow, business is the way to blow
So any place I go, I know my bank can roll
The old heads are schoolin' me, I'm takin' notes
I am hip-hop, it replaced my soul
If I sink to the bottom, then I'ma make a float
I heard the real world's cold, I'ma take a coat
Be prepared, and be aware 'cause failure ain't really even there

Expectations peakin', they wonder what I'm 'bout to do
Spark interest, music, I can count on you, right?
But do I have it all twisted? I went from popular to misfit in an instant
My friends forgot me 'cause they probably seen me hardly
In the lab when I should be out at a party
It drive me crazy, and money is the fuel
Insomniac, awake, findin' somethin' I can do to put the work in
And I'm certain that I'm flirtin' with the fame
Failure gettin' jealous, throwin' dirt up on my name
It's burnin' up my brain, but I'm workin' through my pain
'Cause life's hard 'til you learn it's just a game
Play your cards, use your letters on your Scrabble board
If you smart, put your heart into your rappin' more
No money? Why the fuck you countin' for?
A thousand truants tryin' to get up my allowance more

Lookin' back like there's nothin' that I couldn't do
And there's nothin' that I wouldn't do to bring you back
Poetry, heart and soul, sing and rap
I've been thinkin' that I found my passion
Rappin' 'bout the future in a old-school fashion
 [Chorus]
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things I got to deal with
So, what up cousin?

[Verse 2]
They say my style ain't different, I'm just like everybody else
They say my pitches got to change up
But all those people is just hatin' 'cause they don't know how to love they-self
Mad when someone bring my name up
And it's unfortunate 'cause I'm just here comin' from the heart, shit
I'm just tryna find somethin' for the market
And I ain't sayin' that I'm from the worst hardships
But my life ain't no walk in the park
It's been a shark pit, dark with no harvest
Drivin' in a car but can't find a place to park it
I got some people that I really need to part with
That must've been what got this shit started
There's been some people that I had to say goodbye to
But my life got to go on, and it don't mean that we forget
Because we dedicate our lives to, that's why I wrote this fuckin' song

[Chorus]
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things I got to deal with
So, what up cousin?
 [Verse 3]
Shit's real out here, ain't nobody playin' 'round
I got some bangers and some druggies that I hang around
Everybody do they own thing
And you can find me on the corner makin' money when it's snowing
I sell a lil' weed, get my pockets fat
But I talk to cats who been movin' lots of crack
It ain't the good life, it ain't the bad, it's just makin' the best of what we have
I'll put the dollars down and move into the lab
That's how much I want this music shit to last
And some days I feel it's movin' too fast
School's gon' pass, not rememberin' a class
Suddenly, before you know, it's time to grow up
Focus on the real, try not to get your hopes up
So far I've had some hard work and a little luck
Once I make it to the money, I ain't gon' give it up

[Chorus]
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things I got to deal with
So, what up cousin?"

Well, some years went by, time move fast
Tryin' to remember where you find me at
When I was young, when I was young
It's such a beautiful world, I wanna see the whole thing
Goin' places, not a single person knows me
Glad I'm still young, I'm glad I'm still young

[Verse 1]
Uh, look, yeah
As I drive around the city that I live in
Lookin' all around me, I remember bein' children
Just havin' fun, we was some wild ones
With a three-mile-long smile on
As a kid causin' mischief, just monkey business
Stayin' up past midnight was such a privilege
I didn't have to worry 'bout shit
Fall and cut your knee, get the first aid kit
Had a crush on a girl, you wanna hold hands
Heard a slow jam, ask your girl to slow dance
Mom read me stories, thought I was Peter Pan
Pops did his thing, he taught me to be a man
Life went by fast, now I'm 'bout to be eighteen
Lookin' in the mirror, seein' what the world made me
And I'm satisfied, I think I'm doin' fine
Lookin' at the jungle gym I used to climb, I think

Well, some years went by, time move fast
Tryin' to remember where you find me at

Glad I'm still young, I'm glad I'm still young

[Verse 2]
Uh
Then high school started, I'm rememberin' that
Walkin' round the halls, no clue where I was at
With my backpack, pants sagged, half mask
Crackin' jokes just tryin' to make the class laugh
I was and still am the kid that'll keep you smilin'
Little ladies man, girls never was a challenge
Never on the honor roll, too much chronic smoke
Am I in college? No, but to be honest though
I wouldn't have it any other way
I do it all the same if it was any other day
You gon' know when the time is good
'Cause ain't nothin' comin' close to your childhood

[Chorus]
Well, some years went by, time move fast
Tryin' to remember where you find me at

Empty out ya pockets, necklaces and watches

A lot to read, chronic greens kids will cop from me
Stockin' cheese 'til I'm doin' this hip-hop for free

They feeds from my jams like I'm spittin' out some poppy seeds

They wonder what's influencin' my music that I make
My mind stay never lettin' time wait

Words I wrote cleverly over these dope melodies
I'ma keep spittin' 'til I least broke seventy

Takin' off her clothes 'fore I begin to speak like, ""Gimme cheeks""
Been to London, been to France, go there if you get the chance
Been to Amsterdam, hit the club, hell no, I didn't dance
Rolled around a little, smoked the weed, seen the red lights
Ain't fuck a prostitute but the head nice, get right
From here on to the next life, relax and sip that Red Stripe
Way I spend this money, you would think I had a ex-wife
Bitches love the lead pipe, the 'Burgh, word to Ken Rice
New place every day, what I would give to just have ten nights
Yeah, right, 'bout to drop an album, hope to blow your mind
Tryna reach a level where no music is put over mine

[Chorus]
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up 'cause you don't live that long
Or am I wrong?

What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up 'cause you don't live that long (How about another one?)

Hey
It's young Macintosh, tell you 'bout that sabotage
Travelin' through Germany, word to David Hasselhoff
Back up off me, kill 'em softly, bitches like to fuck 'em doggy
Prolly off some molly, got me turnin' into polygons
On and on, DJ's puttin' on my song
People say I talk too long, killin' every single track the God is on
They cheerin' with their pom-poms, buyin' what I got on
Straight gold, find me fuckin' Silver with my Long John
Tom Tom, direct me to that money please
Square sponge, fuckin' dumb, yeah, your grades is under C
And I know, ""In God we trust,"" but how much do they trust in me?
Enough to be a fuckin' beast on beats, yeah
Shit is so disgustingly amazin', bitches out the playpen
You fuck your hand, askin', ""How much money can I fit into this rubberband?""
Hustlin', throw your ass right inside a rubbish can
Excuse my French, that's just how I'd talk if I was Russell Brand
Know that I'm the fuckin' man, play my shit for three days
""All I make is hits, call me T-Pain!""
Sicker than if she gave me AIDS, plus some teeth decay
Then she stole my condom, try to auction it on eBay
Talk a little shit, man, probably thought he dissed me
Bitch, please, I just ate out Monica Lewinsky
Yeah, I taught her 'bout some slaughter, had her cryin' 'bout her father
Then I busted in her face while she told me, ""It's an honor""
Bob O'Connor, we just politickin', finger-lickin' on my chicken
Got a way with words, words, words, word to Charles Dickens
I wrote this on the shitter usin' toilet paper
Then put your head inside the waters, enjoy the flavor, heh

Yeah, bitch
Nah, Jerm, don't cut me off, man
Fuck you
Ha-ha

Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up 'cause you don't live that long
Or am I wrong?
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D

What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up 'cause you don't live that long

The East End Empire, I'm somethin' like a Chaka Khan
It's the planet Earth, I brought it here to garden on
My fifth year in, but I'm hungrier than Ramadan
I'm tryna get that parsley, not deal with the paparazzi
My rap style is sloppy, I never ask for handouts
I been a little homie, but it's time to be the man now
This thе type of music that'll give my mom a grandchild

Wonder who the fuck we're supposed to be
I ain't worried now 'til I leave

Wind in my face, don't stop now when it feels so great
You can run 'til you slip on the sidewalk
And the same bone that you picked gon' break, that's a motif

Nobody holdin' my hand, no
Trust is a problem, never knew how, yeah
That's why I just keep to myself
Get what I need, then I'll be out (Please tell me)
Who can surf the universe with me?
Lucifer is human, so are we
All I ever want is what I need

Follow me, we on the up and up

And when it's night time with the shine of the city lights
Same day, different mic, what you livin' like?
Travel around the country, always at the airport, different flights
It's anything but the simple life
I break the law, fuck a magistrate
And I laugh at hate
Revenge a dish served cold, y'all can grab a plate
Gravitate towards the money and the fame
But it ain't all what it seem, boy, it's just another game
No Wii, Xbox, or PS3
Just good weed and some Henny, you can leave me be
Maybe find me in the west coast like Eazy-E
They in a coma, been asleep for weeks, but now they wakin' up
They notice that the youngin got skill
Yeah, I'm white, but you can't put a color on ill

Architect my life but you can't design my destiny
All the family that I lost, rest in peace
Wish you was here to see me catch my dream
I've chased my shadow, now I'm on another level
At the playground playin' freeze tag with the devil
I ain't gonna sell my soul though
This music worth more than hoes, boats, and polo, haha
No college, but bet I win the Rose Bowl
The way I smoke got my moms goin' loco
Live on my own now, payin' rent and shit
When life stress gets thick, you need some sedatives
A little weed and a little bit of liquor, uh

Shit ain't all picture-perfect, it's cool, I'm gettin' by
Wake up and smell the roses, go ahead and taste some wine
I travel around the globe (Globe), done a thousand shows (Shows)
Designer laundry, that's a real expensive pile of clothes (Dough)
I'm on the internet a lot, my life surrounds my phone (It does)

If you don't call me king, I'll gladly throw you out of Rome (Woah)

So shouts to those of you who stuck around through Funkytown (This Funkytown)

I don't believe I'm crazy (No), but Jesus need to save me
'Fore I fuck around, go underground, and end up deep in Haiti (Haiti)
I'm feelin' pretty good, please don't worry 'bout me (Don't worry)
Still got the juice, all these hoes actin' thirsty 'round me (So thirsty)
How it felt to be myself, I couldn't word it proudly (I was sad)

You keep turnin' me on, where will we go wrong?"

You know sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and I hate what I see!
I want you to clap your hands (Sorry, sorry), stomp your feet, lick your lips
Here we go (Here we go)

[Pre-Chorus]
The sun goes down, the night rolls in
You can feel it starting all over again
The moon comes up, and the music calls
You're getting tired of staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room, and you're down on the street
Moving through the crowd, through the midnight heat
The traffic roars, and the sirens scream
You look at faces, it's just like a dream
So nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you're going (1, 2, 3, Go!)

[Chorus]
'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness, beneath the neon light (Yes!)
You were born in the city (Ay, ay, ay)
Concrete under your feet (Woo-woo!)
It's in your moves, it's  in your blood
You're a man of the street
 [Verse]
When you said goodbye, you were on the run
Tryna get away from all the things you done
Now you're back again, and you're feeling strange
So much has happened, but nothing has changed
You still don't know where you're going (Get a GPS)
You're still just a face in the crowd (1, 2, 3, Go!)

[Chorus]
'Cause you belong to the city (Woo)
You belong to the night (Yeah!)
Living in a river of darkness, beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet (Yeah)
It's in your blood, it's in your moves
You're a man of the street

[Bridge]
If you can feel it
You can taste it
If you can see it
Said you can face it
If you can hear it
You're getting near it
Do you want to make it?
'Cause you can take it (1, 2, 3, Go!)
 [Chorus]
'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night (You, you right there)
You belong to the city (You belong, and you belong)
You belong to the night (You belong, and you belong, we all belong)

[Outro]
Alright, alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I wanna sing you a song, I wanna sing you
'Cause you're my special, tell baby that I love–
Please come to me, let me touch your hair
Eugh"

I been waiting so long (Been waiting)
To have you by my side (Tell you, ""I love you"")
I, I can't do no wrong (No, you are an angel)
With you by my side, you are my—

[Post-Chorus 1]
And when you look in my eyes

Euphoria (Euphoria)

[Verse 2]
You feel so damn good (I want you to know that)
Just come take my hand (Closer) (So hear me out)
And we could go to the moon
Look in my eyes as we land (We're here now)

[Chorus]
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
 [Post-Chorus 2]
And when you lay in my arms
The pain goes a-way

Imaginary girlfriend, imaginary whores, imaginary virgins (Virgins)
Imaginary Gods, imaginary evils, protect me with a cross (Cross)
Imaginary senses
Go and fight a war for imaginary vengeance (Vengeance)
My old bitch imaginary pregnant
Guess I'll be a dad with imaginary presents (Presents)
Pockets full of imaginary money, ask me how it feel
I imagine that it's stunning (Stunning)
In my dreams, I imagine that I'm running
Very fast, away from an imaginary something (Something)
Imaginary enemies
Live under my skin with imaginary tendencies (Tendencies)
Meet imaginary Suzie
Killed herself tryna reach imaginary beauty (Beauty)

[Chorus]
Imaginary, imaginary, imaginary, imaginary
Imaginary, imaginary, imaginary, imaginary

[Verse 2]
Imaginary problems
I like to close my eyes and imagine I'm forgotten (Forgotten)
Imagine I belong in this world with the rest of you
Imaginary goblins (Goblins)
Asleep in this imaginary coffin
Finally get a break from my imaginary conscious (Conscious)
Imaginary images
Killed a man in front of these imaginary witnesses (Witnesses)
Imaginary love
Trippin' balls, high off imaginary drugs (Drugs)
Life and its imaginary sequel
Swimming in a sea full of imaginary people (People)
Imaginary lives
We kill each other seeking an imaginary prize (Prize)
God and his imaginary eyes
Watching what we do, I imagine he's surprised (Surprised)
 [Chorus]
Imaginary, imaginary, imaginary, imaginary
Imaginary, imaginary, imaginary, imaginary

[Outro]
You sir, is it you?
I forbid you any entrance
There's pinks and blues and flowers and trees
All things you won't be able to enjoy
Where you're going
Because where you're going
Is someplace far from here
Enjoy the ride
Your shoes are untied"
