Until then, I'm gettin' dollars, I'm just doin' what I gotta

I swear to God I put the hero in heroin (Dope), these flows kilos

Shit, I could sell water to a speedboat
And these eyes is iconic
I went pro, made profit, now I keep some dead faces in my pocket
Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week (All week)

It won't hold me down no more
 [Chorus]
Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her

Until then, I'm gettin' dollars, I'm just doin' what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all day, homie
I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get 'em all paid
Came a long way from all-state, yeah, now we All-American
(Salute me, shoot me) Shit, we All-American
(Salute me, shoot me down)

[Verse]
Yeah, okay
Back then they used to call me little

They haven't got the memo, I'm sayin' I'm the shit, though
Tryna make it complicated when this shit is simple (Simple)
Tell me what you wanna be, what your dreams is (What your dreams is)

Sin every day, someone save me please
And get schooled, homie, change degrees (Uh-huh)
I'm the plug, what you need though? (What you need though?) I'm goin' beast mode
I keep a freak, even when she underwater she can deep throat (Wait, what?)
I made a mill' before I paid a bill (Okay)
'Cause fools worried about a wave, I'm a Navy SEAL (Okay)
Come with me, I can make your life change for real (Woo)
Always had a dream of stuntin', it ain't nothin' unless you runnin' shit (Woo)
Just a young ma'fucker with a plan (With a plan)
Thought I was the man
 [Chorus]
Back when I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was the shit (Oh, you the shit?)
When I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was a king (Oh, you a king?)
When I first made a hundred grand
Couldn't tell me nuttin' (I ain't sayin' nuttin')
When I first made a hundred grand
Made a hundred grand (Let me get some money)

What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
ספר לי על הפחדים שלך
What are you afraid of? (Uh)
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
One-two, one-two, uh
Tell me your fears
Sometimes I see the... Is everything okay?
ספר לי על הפחדים שלך, uh
Tell me your fears

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Sometimes I see the world for how fucked up it really is
I tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it
I could die tonight, not make it to the sunrise
Then I couldn't heal the pain in it
I'm gettin' high to forget about the lows, though
Get a pay check, spend it all on polo
Designer brands cover up my insecurities
Personally I ain't nothin' but an average Joe, though
Now I'm dressin' so expensive for no reason
Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezin'
I got some fam who can't afford a coat
So I leave a little paper there before I go
Spent a thousand on a hotel, they poor and broke
Made me wonder who I'm prayin' to before the show
This a letter to whoever, I'm just tryna set you free
Remember love if you can't remember me
 [Chorus: Mac Miller]
Dear people on Earth after I die
What's the weather like?
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
And I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe
Get a second life
This time I'ma get it right

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
It's either God or the devil with these drugs I'm on
I don't know if we were meant to see it all like this
Still, plantin' seeds so my money long
Money addict, it's a habit that palms gon' itch
I wish we could just all get rich
Sometimes not havin' money is all I miss
And, yeah, these hoes are all up on my dick
The all American girl, that's just a blonde hair bitch
Am I supposed to have some thoughts like this?
Could we figure out what God might've miss?
It's funny that these questions never get an answer
Life a bitch sometimes, you gotta reprimand her
Never understand her, why should I even try?
Live forever then you'll never feel the need to die
This a letter, open it to set you free
Remember love and remember me
 [Chorus: Mac Miller]
Dear people on Earth after I die
What's the weather like?
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
And I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe
Get a second life
This time I'ma get it right

[Outro: Mac Miller]
What does it mean to be a sensation?
Do you have to be sensational?
And how you know you made it?
When you're with Killa Cam watchin' Paid in Full, I
Never had good grades in school, but
Shock the world is what I came to do, I
Got a song I wanna play for you
So can you sing that back to me? I said
What does it mean to be a sensation?
Do you have to be sensational?
How you know you made it?
When you're with Killa Cam watchin' Paid in Full, I
Never had good grades in school, but
Shock the world is what I came to do, I
Got a song I wanna play for you
So can you sing that back to me?"

Yeah

[Verse 1]
We fill their head with lies, like lemme change yo' life
Let's become friends tonight, I'll show you what Heaven's like
Ma-ma-make sure yo' dress is tight, show me them legs and thighs
Feel it up, girl, that's just right, sex is an exercise
Th-th-th-these dudes intimidated, you-you-you got 'em petrified
N-n-n-n-now you gettin' naked, girl, you just read my mind
Pop this, get energized, sniff this, get еxtra high
All them celebs you likе, let's be just like them tonight
You work from 10 to 5, strippin' to just get by
You ain't no weddin' bride, open up, lemme check inside
That well is never dry, must confess, I'll testify
Lord, that pussy felt divine, I came back a second time

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I see them temptin' eyes, you on yo' best behavior
You got work in the mornin', we'll worry 'bout that later
This time, girl, let it slide, you feel so wet inside
That pussy never lie (Good, good), girl, that pussy never lie

[Chorus]
It's 2004 (Good, good; girl, that pussy never lie)
It's 2004 (That-that-that-that-that-that pussy never lie)
Girl, do it like 2004 (Good, good, good, good; girl, that pussy never lie)
Girl, do it like 2004 (That pussy never lie, that-that pussy never lie)
 [Open Verse]

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I see them temptin' eyes, you on yo' best behavior
You got work in the mornin', we'll worry 'bout that later
This time, girl, let it slide, you feel so wet inside
That pussy never lie (Good, good), girl, that pussy never lie

[Chorus]
It's 2004 (Good, good; girl, that pussy never lie)
It's 2004 (That-that-that-that-that-that pussy never lie)
Girl, do it like 2004 (Good, good, good, good; girl, that pussy never lie)
Girl, do it like 2004 (That pussy never lie, that-that pussy never lie)"

Yeah
Eric
Well

[Chorus]
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' ""Why?"" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

[Verse 1]
Yeah, okay, you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's alright with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'
The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about
And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yea high and muddy
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me
 [Chorus]
But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' ""Why?"" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war
See, me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it, I was diggin' me a hole
Big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
My own, with these arms I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone, and I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm
 [Chorus]
Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' ""Why?"" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' ""Why?"" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door"

I could see why they get so jealous
I want it all for myself, I'm selfish
I don't consider that greedy, 'cause there just ain't enough to go around
Every now and then I freak out, 'cause I work week round to make sure we all good
There just ain't enough to go around

[Verse]
Yeah, well
Why does everybody look so worried?
Why they always running, but they never in a hurry?
I just want to show off my brand new car
It cost so much, I'm too scared to park it
We swimming in this ocean, though beware of sharks please
They'll get you if come within arms reach
I'm cooking somеthing, get away from my parsley
I hit the lick and dip in thе Harley
My life so gnarly, beyond your wildest dreams
Private planes, flying the wings
Diamonds and things
Super, super stardom
What a tree, god damn I'm starving
It ain't no bargain
Rake your leaves and make your garden, grow your trees
The bullshit nothing, 'til it go to my knees
Came a long way from that little apartment
 [Chorus]
I could see why they get so jealous
I want it all for myself, I'm selfish
I don't consider that greedy, 'cause there just ain’t enough to go around
Every now and then I freak out, 'cause I work week round to make sure we all good
There just ainenough to go around"
